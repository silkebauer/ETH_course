# General information

In normal times, we would hold the course at the Col de Bretolet with visits to the bird ringing station. Unfortunately, the regulations and recommendations with regard to Covid19 do not allow us to hold the course in its traditional format and we have come up with an alternative that still contains lectures and student work but only one-day or half-day excursions. Lectures may be followed in Sempach or remotely via zoom; student work can also be done in person in Sempach or remotely via slack (see below).
We hope that you can safely enjoy the course in this alternative format and we hope that we can still bring across the fascination of migration. 


**Lectures** can be followed in person at the Swiss Ornithological Institute in Sempach or via zoom (link provided via email).
How to get there:

* Travel by train to Sempach-Neuenkirch
* From the train station, follow the signposts to "Vogelwarte" - it's a 10 min walk
* Enter the red office building on the right-hand side of the street and follow the signs within the building


**Excursions**


**Student projects** are ideally conducted in grous of 2-4 persons. We expect students to choose a project before the course (see list of potential projects \@ref(Sec:StudentProjects)) and read and summarize the respective literature. There are several slots for work on these projects over the course week and we expect students to give a brief (approx. 20 min) presentation on Friday, detailing the ecological question behind the project, the analytical approach chosen, the results obtained and a discussion. 


## Online lectures via zoom - a brief how-to

As most participants have indicated they hav used zoom before, we will send a link for the zoom lectures but still explain a few useful features during the first lecture on Monday.  

## Collaborating via Slack

You will receive an invitation from us to join slack and the workspace ETH_MigrationCourse. Slack is a collaboration app that you can either use as a desktop- or an browser-based app. Go to [link](https://slack.com) to see more details and to access it.
We will give a brief introduction on the first day on how we envisage to interact with you via slack.

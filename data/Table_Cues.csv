 ;Preparation;Departure;On the way;Termination
Insects;Photoperiod, Crowding during immature stages, Habitat deterioration (food, predation or parasitism);Favourable flying conditions, e.g. tailwinds;Time-compensated sun compass;"Migration reduces inhibition to appetitive cues (in mig. bout); depletion of fuel reserves, changes in photoperiod or temperature"
Fish;"Reach minimum body size; for some: physiological adaptation to new environment";Salmon: Autumn river discharge;Local food search, or long distance spawning location tracking;Arrival in locations favourable for spawning
Turtles;Light regime, internal status, and migratory restlessness;Favourable departure conditions, e.g. night, with currents;Visual information (bright skylight), direction of waves, geomagnetic field, wind;Arrival on specific target location, e.g. feeding or wintering grounds
Birds;Photoperiod, Build-up flight apparatus, Reduction digestive system;Favourable flight conditions (wind, rain, air pressure), Fuelling rate and body stores, Cumulative temperature or related proxy;Sun compass, magnetic field, skylight polarisation, star pattern, Direction under hormonal control, sometimes responses to local conditions;Arrival on specific target-location, e.g. breeding or wintering grounds, Na√Øve birds have an inherent migratory period
Bats;Accumulate fat deposits (torpor during fuelling periods);Early night hours, low wind speeds;Not much known, probably use magnetic field;unknown
Large mammals;No particular (physiological) preparations;Seasonal changes in temperature, precipitation and water quality but evidence anecdotal, animals follow gradients;Not much known;

Tags;Weight;Data recorded;Pros;Cons
Archival tags;;;;
Geolocators;05-1.5g;light and time (?geolocation?);light-weight;recapturing required, data analyses complex, location estimate with large error range
Multi-sensor loggers;1.0-1.5g;In addition to light: temperature, air pressure, activity (acceleration);+ additional information about behavior, e.g. flight height, number and duration of flight bouts, activity during stop-over periods;recapturing required, data analyses complex, location estimate with large error range
GPS loggers;>2.5g;GPS position, possibly other variables temperature, pressure, activity, salinity;huge amount of information, precise location information;"recapturing required; relatively heavy"
Transmitters;;;;
PTT tags;;identification of an individual with a reader at a strategic place (nest, feeding site);small and light-weight (sometimes implanted);
RFID Radio frequency identification;;identification of an individual with a reader at a strategic place (nest, feeding site);small and light-weight (sometimes implanted);readers are expensive, individual can be registered only when within a few meters of the reader (data are often noisy)
Telemetry - radio or VHF ;from 0.3 g onward;"identification of an individual by an antenna over short to medium long distances (0-ca. 20km)
physiological data (from sen-sors)";remote data collections, precise location information;"battery life limited for small transmitters, great effort for data collections; transmitter may influence behaviour"
Satellite telemetry, different systems exist, e.g. ARGOS;> 5g, usually much more ;GPS positions of individuals at any time anywhere on the globe;remote data collections, precise location information, little effort for data collections;large weight, expensive, transmitter may influence behaviour

We expect students to choose a project during the first two days of the course (see list of potential projects ??). There are several slots for work on these projects over the course week and we expect students to give a brief (approx. 20 min) presentation on Friday, detailing the ecological question behind the project, the analytical approach chosen, the results obtained and a discussion. Within the student projects, we will introduce and apply important theoretical approaches and analytical methods 2.2 Course schedule The course consists of lectures, project work and excursions. 2.2.1 Prepatory days 1 &amp; 2: Thursday and Friday, 5-6 September 2024 in Sempach and Zürich 2.2.2 Course day 1: Thursday, 5 September 2024 in Sempach 10:00 - 11:00 Welcome and Introduction Location: Room Aquila at the Swiss Ornithological Institute, Seerose 1, 6204 Sempach.

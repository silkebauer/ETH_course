We expect students to choose a project during the first two days of the course (see list of potential projects 12). There are several slots for work on these projects over the course week and we expect students to give a brief (approx. 20 min) presentation on Friday, detailing the ecological question behind the project, the analytical approach chosen, the results obtained and a discussion. Within the student projects, we will introduce and apply important theoretical approaches and analytical methods. 2.2 Course schedule The course consists of lectures, project work and excursions. 2.2.1 Prepatory days: 2-5 September 2025 at Swiss Ornithological Institute Sempach and ETH Zürich Travel information • To Sempach: Travel by train is around 1.5h from Zürich HB (www.sbb.ch).

"],["animal-migration.html", "Chapter 3 Animal migration 3.1 What is migration? 3.2 Why do birds migrate? 3.3 Terminology of specific migration patterns", " Chapter 3 Animal migration 3.1 What is migration? Not all birds migrate and not all movements are migratory movements. The types of movements that exist range from: local movements between roosting and feeding sites, movements within the home range foraging journeys (e.g. sea birds, swifts), dispersal: juvenile (natal) dispersal, breeding dispersal, migration, including its most common form of seasonal migration but also nomadism and irruptive migrations. Migrations are persistent, directional movements from one destination to another, uninterrupted by intervening resources [Dingle (2014)). The distances covered are often astounding, yet, the most ex-traordinary aspects of migration are perhaps the ubiquity of the phenomenon and the abundance of individuals involved. For instance, an estimated 1855 bird species (19% of extant species) are migrato-ry. Of the avian species that use terrestrial and freshwater habitats, roughly 45% of those breeding in North America undergo seasonal migration, and over 30% breeding in the Palearctic migrate to sub-Saharan Africa, with many more migrating within Europe. Although accurate estimates of the number of individuals involved are scant, more than 2 billion passerine birds are found to migrate to sub-Saharan Africa, whereas upwards of 3 billion insects migrate over any 1-km stretch of countryside in southern England (Hu et al. 2016). Thus, migration is set apart from the other movement types by i) its timing, frequency and predictability, ii) the intensity of interactions with resident species, and iii) the spatial scales over which they connect communities and ecosystems. Figure 3.1: The typical spatial and temporal scales of different movement-types. From (Jeltsch et al. 2013) 3.2 Why do birds migrate? The classic bird migration is the biannual migration between breeding and non-breeding (‘wintering’) grounds. The breeding grounds are suitable for nesting and hatchling/fledgling survival, whereas the wintering grounds are more suitable for post-fledgling and adult survival. Migration is thought to be primarily an adaptation to the seasonality of resources - to use (a surplus of) resources that are only seasonally available and to avoid shortage of resources at specific times of the year. Indeed, almost all places on Earth are seasonal to some degree and therefore, many migrants move between these seasonally available resources (Fig. 3.2). For instance, many birds breeding in Europe migrate to the Sahel-zone in Africa in the Northern winter. The advantage of being in an area that provides better condition outweighs the cost of migration. In the temperate zones, it are usually those species that leave the breeding area during winter that have specific food requirements, which is not available dur-ing winter, e.g. insects, but abundant in the Sahel after rainfall. Many species, e.g. Red-backed shrikes (Lanius collurio) migrate within the non-breeding season between distinct non-breeding areas in order to make use of seasonally changing food availability (Tøttrup et al. 2012). There may be also other forms of migration or migrations as a strategy to avoid predators or pathogens. Other migration than seasonal migration are moult and facultative migrations. In moult migrations, birds migrate to predator-free areas where they can safely shed their flight feathers. In facultative migrations, birds only migrate long-distances when food is sparse, e.g. many finches (Newton 2006). At an extreme end of the spectrum are birds that are nomadic, like grey teal (Anas gracilis) looking for ephemeral water and food sources in a desert landscape in Australia. Two main flight modes exist – flapping and soaring, which has consequences on when and where birds migrate: Flapping flight is energetically costly but can be used under a wide range of weather and topographic conditions, whereas for soaring thermals or wind are needed. The majority of birds cannot feed while flying, and in many cases the total travel distance exceeds the maximum flight distance. Thus, the birds need stop-over sites in between, where they can replenish their reserves. A good example are tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) that migrate between 4000-5500 km, whereas the maximally recorded non-stop flight is 2850 km. These swans mainly refuel on energy-rich, belowground parts of macrophytes in shallow lakes and wetlands along the route. Figure 3.2: Seasonal change in global NDVI. These vegetation maps were generated from MODIS/Terra measurements of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Significant seasonal variations in the NDVI are apparent between northern hemisphere summer (July 2014; top) and winter (February 2015; bottom).

Often it is a specific characteristic or pattern that is emphasized, e.g. the difference in distances covered led to the distinction of short- and long-distance migrants. However, the terminology is not very consistent and may be confusing at the beginning; we explain the most-frequently occurring terms below. 3.3.1 Characterisation of migration according to distances covered Short-distance migration Migration over ‘shorter’ distances, typically &lt;5000kms, e.g. from Central Europe to the Mediterranean. Sometimes, short-distance migrants are also partial migrants. Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) Long-distance migration Migration over longer distances, usually &gt;5000kms and often including the crossing of ecological barriers such as mountains, seas or deserts. Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea), Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) 3.3.2 Characterisation of migration according to daytime of travel Nocturnal migration Most songbirds migrate at night, i.e. they are nocturnal migrants. This behavior has been attributed to reduced predation risk, good flight conditions, or for saving the daylight for feeding. Nocturnal migrants mostly fly alone or in loose flocks. Typical example: Most migratory songbirds, e.g. Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) Diurnal migration Migratory flights take place during the day. Many larger birds are diurnal migrants, e.g. birds of prey that use thermals or swans and geese that often fly in flocks. Typical examples: raptors, bee-eaters, many geese species 3.3.3 Characterisation of migration according to larger-scale patterns of migratory bouts Leap-frog migrations Populations breeding further north spend the non-breeding season further south than breeding populations from further south. Thus, some populations “overtake” others on migration. European robin (Erithacus rubecula) (F. Korner-Nievergelt, Liechti, and Thorup 2014) Chain migration Northern breeding populations spend the non-breeding period in breeding areas of southern populations. Thus, a species can be observed year-round but it are different individuals in winter/ summer. Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) (Frederiksen et al. 2018) Broad front migration Individuals disperse over the whole distributional range while migrating (theoretically a lot of parallel flight tracks dispersed over a large area). Yet, migrants can still accumulate depending on topography and funnel through narrow areas. Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), many passerines: (Liechti et al. 1996) Funnel migration All individuals of a species (or population) concentrate on migration in one stop-over area or a topographically important place such as Gibraltar in Europe or the Yellow Sea in Asia. Crane (Grus grus), many waders (Yellow sea!) Seasonal migration Nomadism Irregular (not every year) movements to new breeding or non-breeding areas depending on food availability or other environmental conditions. Crossbill (Loxia curvirostra) Irruptive migration Migration of unusually many individuals of one species. Often from north to south in autumn after a good breeding season and a cold spell; usually do not occur every year but can be relatively regular and synchronized between species (Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2008). Great tit (Parus major), Coal tit (Parus ater) Moult migration Migration after the breeding season to distinct places where the birds moult before autumn migration. Goosanders (Mergus merganser) (European populations moult in northern Norway) Partial migration Only a part of a population migrates while the remaining part stays resident. Which individuals stay and which migrate has often a genetic background, and in some years, the migrato-ry part enjoys a fitness benefit while in other years the resi-dents are better off.

Cues! 4.3 Consequences of migration timing", " Chapter 4 Timing of migration 4.1 Why is timing important? The timing of migration (and other life-history activities) is widely considered to have significant fitness consequences (Forrest &amp; Miller-Rushing 2010, Miller-Rushing &amp; et al. 2010). Particularly in seasonal environments, timing is the all-dominant predictor of success – for instance migration, growth or repro-duction should coincide with favourable conditions and avoid unfavourable periods. Thus, such activities need to be initiated within a specific – often very restricted – timeframe. Penalties for not migrating at the optimal time range from slight reductions in reproductive success (e.g. raising fewer offspring or offspring with lower survival prospects) to fatal consequences (e.g. mistiming of migration leading to starvation (Newton 2007). Besides immediate penalties there may also be time-lagged consequences (e.g. carry-over effects; Harrison et al. 2011), since current mistiming may bear a cost later in life. 4.2 What determines the timing of migratory steps? Cues! Photoperiod has been shown to be involved in the timing of activities for many species, e.g. initiating “Zugunruhe” or determining the speed of migratory progression, as it indicates time of the year and thus, can be a useful predictor for the phenology of resources (Fig. 3.2). Other, local and short-term factors influencing timing of migration include prevailing weather conditions, e.g. temperature, wind, drought and precipitation, as these factors can significantly influence the costs of the travel ahead or its consequences for survival (Silke Bauer et al. 2011). There are also internal cues that serve as a clock or time-keeping mechanism. Additionally, physiological state and developmental stage are important cues as most migrants undergo morphological and physiological changes in preparation for migration and internal signals, e.g. hormone levels, indicate when these changes are completed. Migration can be divided into a few major steps – preparation, departure, on the way, and ter-mination – a cycle that might be repeated if migration is suspended at intermittent stop-over sites. Each of these steps potentially requires specific cues and decision rules as the demands on the animal’s physiology and behaviour differ. Similarities might exist across taxonomic groups in how animals deal with each of these steps but differences may also be expected depending on the specific way of mi-grating or their particular environment (Table 4.1). 4.2.1 Preparation Before actually embarking on migration, most birds (partly) change the composition of their bodies, e.g. increase flight muscles at the expense of leg muscles, atrophy digestive and metabol-ic organs (Piersma &amp; van Gils 2011) and accumulate body stores. Photoperiod is an important external signal for preparations; it initiates “Zugunruhe”, i.e. migratory restlessness (Gwinner 1990), and birds start accumulating body stores, altering their digestive system and building up flight muscles from a particular day length onwards. The specific value of day length, at which these transformations are started, is under strong genetic control (Newton 2008:324). However, also birds kept under constant day length for up to several years still showed a cir-cannual rhythm with the right sequence of annual events (migratory fat deposition and restlessness, gonad development, and moult) suggesting that getting into the migratory state is under internal control (Gwinner 1977). But these cycles tend to drift and be either shorter or (most often) longer than a calen-dar year. This internal control is most rigid in long-distance migrants that are normally confronted with most variation in day length. Thus, under natural conditions the exact timing of events is most likely determined by a combi-nation of internal and external factors such that the internal system is adjusted by seasonal changes in photoperiod, as has been shown with experiments with extra light or shorter than annual cycles (Newton 2008: 321, 358). 4.2.2 Departure The exact timing of migratory departure is fine-tuned by secondary factors like tempera-ture, wind, rain and food supplies (Newton 2008: 322, 353-354). Birds choose favourable flight condi-tions and preferably leave on days with tail-winds and no rain. In the Swainson’s thrush (Catharus ustulatus), departure decisions are best predicted by both a high daily temperature (&gt; 20°C) and low wind speeds (&lt; 10 km/h) at the time of presumed take-off. If one of these conditions is not met, the individual will not take off. However, such apparently strict rules also lead to serious errors, e.g. individuals take off at low local winds, and yet ascend into air streams that will push them backwards against their flight direction (Cochran &amp; Wikelski 2005). One means by which birds may forecast improving weather condition before they actually occur has been hypothesized to be sensing air pressure changes (Newton 2008: 255, Keeton 1980). In facultative migrants, departure may also be delayed until weather conditions for refuelling deteriorate (Newton 2008: 348). The decisions to depart from a stop-over site are likely based on rather simple behavioural rules. Passerines that lose or increase fuel stores at a high rate leave a site quickly, whereas the intermediate birds stage the longest (Schaub et al. 2008). Geese use a mixture of endogenous and external cues, with the endogenous cues having a stronger effect as the season progresses (Silke Bauer, Gienapp, and Madsen 2008). 4.2.3 On the way Birds use several cues to guide them in the right direction on long-distance migration – for details on them, see under ??. 4.2.4 Termination When tested under identical conditions in the lab, the duration of migratory restlessness is longer in long- than in short-distance migrants, even within species. Cross-breeding experiments showed that this is an inherited trait (see also Berthold 1999 for an experiment with hybrids of red-starts). In birds from the same species, those wintering furthest away from the breeding grounds show a tendency to start spring migration earlier. Juvenile blue-winged teal Anas discors caught in autumn, and held captive for a while, migrated, after release at the same site, less far than normal. This shows that the decision to stop is at least partly under genetic control. However, in adult birds the opposite was found, with the migratory restlessness continuing longer than normal when held captive for a while during spring migration (Newton 2008: 343). Also, when held at the breeding location, indigo buntings Passerina cyanea did not migrate after release in spring, whereas the control birds that were displaced 1000 km to the south did. The same was true for white storks Ciconia ciconia reared in captivity and released in a reintroduction programme. In experienced birds, the decision to stop is therefore appar-ently influenced by cues indicating that the familiar locality has been reached. If we look at cues that are used by migratory animals other than birds, there are naturally many differ-ences due to the specifics of each species’ migration but also considerable similarities: In all species, preparations for migration involve entrainment to time of the year as all environments are seasonal to some degree and thus, particular times are more suitable for particular activities. Indeed, even for very small levels of seasonality animals should migrate in order to make use of the varying levels of food in different areas. Therefore, the occurrence of photoperiod as a cue in almost all taxa is not surprising. As migration is a daunting activity in the life- or annual cycle of most animals, it also requires changes in the body – ranging from the accumulation of energy stores, the build-up of the locomotion apparatus - often at the expense of the digestive and/or reproductive system, to the transformation of a freshwater- to a seawater-adapted life-form or the achievement of a particular developmental stage. Whenever these changes are accomplished, an internal cue is produced indicating that the animal is ready to depart. For the actual departure on migration often another external cue is involved, which is usually related to travel conditions, e.g. wind, precipitation, temperature. Thus, animals prefer to depart during periods of favourable conditions, for instance, flying animals wait for tailwinds in their preferred direc-tions; swimming animals use river discharge or sea-currents. On-the-way orientation and navigation determines the migration route taken but may also be involved in indicating when migration is to be terminated. Animals heading for a specific location need to recognise this location, which is only an option for experienced animals, whereas naive individuals (e.g. first-time migrants) need to have a genetic programme that signals when to stop. Alternatively, migrations without clear endpoints, e.g. between feeding locations, may involve physiological cues for the termination of migration. Here again, internal signals play a greater role as they indicate when a threshold state is reached, e.g. sufficient body reserves have been accumulated for a subsequent breeding attempt. Table 4.1: The cues used in various taxa for timing migration Taxon Preparation Departure On.the.way Termination Insects Photoperiod, Crowding during immature stages, Habitat deterioration (food, predation or parasitism) Favourable flying conditions, e.g. tailwinds Time-compensated sun compass Migration reduces inhibition to appetitive cues (in mig. bout), depletion of fuel reserves, changes in photoperiod or temperature Fish Reach minimum body size, for some - physiological adaptation to new environment Salmon - Autumn river discharge Local food search, or long distance spawning location tracking Arrival in locations favourable for spawning Turtles Light regime, internal status, and migratory restlessness Favourable departure conditions, e.g. night, with currents Visual information (bright skylight), direction of waves, geomagnetic field, wind Arrival on specific target location, e.g. feeding or wintering grounds Birds Photoperiod, Build-up flight apparatus, Reduction digestive system Favourable flight conditions (wind, rain, air pressure), Fuelling rate and body stores, Cumulative temperature or related proxy Sun compass, magnetic field, skylight polarisation, star pattern, Direction under hormonal control, sometimes responses to local conditions Arrival on specific target-location, e.g. breeding or wintering grounds, Naive birds have an inherent migratory period Bats Accumulate fat deposits (torpor during fuelling periods) Early night hours, low wind speeds Not much known, probably use magnetic field unknown Large mammals No particular (physiological) preparations Seasonal changes in temperature, precipitation and water quality but evidence anecdotal, animals follow gradients Not much known unknown 4.3 Consequences of migration timing Please note that we have talked about one aspect of migration timing so far – phenology – but the timing of migration can be characterised by three complementary dimensions – synchrony, phenology, and consistency. Migration phenology describes the timing of migratory steps - arrival, departure and staging times at sites - relative to the phenology of other relevant processes, e.g. temporal availability of key-resources or presence and abundance of other species and populations. At the two extremes, the migrants’ presence on a particular site fully coincides with, e.g. resource peaks (‘matched’) or is completely separated from the availability of resources (‘mismatched’). Migration synchrony describes how wide-spread over time individuals of a population migrate. At one extreme, all individuals migrate at the same time – synchronously - while at the other, individuals migrate at different times - asynchronously. Specific examples of asynchronous migration include differential migration, where (age-, sex-, or family-)subgroups of a population migrate at different times. Finally, consistency de-scribes how repeatable migration phenology and synchrony are over time - usually over several migra-tions. These three aspects of migration timing can have different consequences on individual fitness and the dynamics of populations but also on a variety of other processes. Figure 4.1: . The timing of migration – here exemplarily from a non-breeding site via an intermittent staging to a breeding site – can be characterised by synchrony (left panel) and phenology (right panel). Migration synchrony describes in how far individual migrants depart, stay or arrive at the same time, i.e. synchronously, or at different times, i.e. asynchronously. Migration phenology relates the timing of migration to the phenology of other populations and species, with which migrants interact, e.g. via competition, predation, etc. We exemplarily depicted various degrees of coincidence between migrant visitation and resource availability (upper-right panel) that influence the migrants’ fitness and may range from positive under complete overlap to negative when migrant visitation and resource availability are fully mismatched. From (Silke Bauer, Lisovski, and Hahn 2016) Resources usually change seasonally but often also at time-scales similar to the visitation of migrants. Therefore, variations in the phenology of migration will lead to a population experiencing on average different resource levels, abundances of competitors and predators (‘phenological match/mismatch’, Johansson et al. (2015)) If, for instance, resource availability at one site changes as a consequence of natural decay or due to finite resources being exhausted, early migrants would benefit from abundant resources compared to late migrants. This is exemplified in a population of Arctic breeding geese, where individuals that arrived at stop-over locations at the peak of vegetation growth had a higher breeding success (Kölzsch et al. 2015). Similarly, within-population competition may be alleviated under asynchronous migration while it is fully effective under synchronous migration (Skoglund et al. 2011), e.g. as in the exclusion of competitively inferior individuals from high-quality foraging patches (Beauchamp 2012, Eichhorn et al. 2009). Alternatively, synchronous migration can be beneficial if the joint consumption of a resource increases its quality or productivity, as in the case of grazing by migratory geese on a spring stop-over site (Stahl et al. 2006) or the increased productivity of the African savannah through the temporal grazing of migratory herbivores (Holdo et al. 2007). The level of predation (incl. hunting) may also change at the time-scale of migrant visitation, e.g. as resulting from seasonal hunting permissions or mobile predators. For instance, hunting on spring-migrating geese in Russia is permitted during 10 days of peak migration and individuals migrating out-side this 10-day hunting window experience much lower mortality risks (Mooij et al. 1999). Similarly, late-migrating sandpipers responded to the arrival of predators (peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus) on a common stop-over site with behavioural changes, e.g. increased vigilance, reduced foraging and consequently, reduced migration speed – behaviours that early-migrants failed to show (Hope et al. 2014). The timing of migration can also influence the degree of gene flow between populations –as a result of either spatial or temporal segregation (Bensch et al. 2009, Moussy et al. 2013, Webster and Marra 2005). A prominent example is the European blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), in which there is no or very little gene flow between two sub-populations despite them meeting at a common breeding site. This is mainly explained by differences in arrival and onset of breeding between these sub-populations that segregated them temporally and resulted in assortative mating, restricted gene flow and ultimately, phenotypic divergence (Bearhop et al. 2005, Berthold et al. 1992). Another process that can be influenced by the timing of migration is the transmission of parasites and the dynamics of diseases: Infections impair the fitness of migrant hosts, e.g. directly through increased mortality but also indirectly through costly immune responses. Disease symptoms may range from fatigue, reduced foraging or movement, which may knock-on to lower fuelling rates, later departure and eventually, in reduced reproductive success or survival. Depending on the proportion of a population being infected and the severity of effects, this may severely influence population demographic rates (Hudson et al. 2002). Depending on the timing of migration, migrants can experience very different levels of parasite pressure because parasite prevalence may vary over time, e.g. resulting from varia-tions in environmental conditions (Reperant et al. 2010), density of potential hosts (Gaidet et al. 2012) or the influx of immunologically naïve individuals, such that there are periods during which transmission is more likely than in others (Hoye et al. 2011). The further transmission of parasites then depends on infectious individuals actually meeting suscepti-ble (un-infected) individuals to transmit parasites, which might be efficiently prevented when infected and uninfected individuals migrate at different times. For instance in Monarch butterflies (Danaus plex-ippus), individuals infected with a protozoon parasite migrated at lower speeds than their healthy con-specifics (Bradley and Altizer 2005) and such “migratory escape” introduced a barrier to the spread of parasites that consequently reduced parasite-prevalence in the population (Altizer et al. 2011, Hall et al. 2014).

Using orientation cages the amount of activity and the preferred direction can be measured. This also allows experimenting with different cues that may affect bird orientation. That birds use the sun for orientation has first been shown by Karl Schmidt-Koenig (Schmidt-Koenig 1958, 1961). He shifted the internal clock of homing pigeons. This resulted in an expected directional error when homing to the loft. The sun is used as a compass. The brightest part of the sky, if visible, is interpreted as the sun and only the azimuth is important. Directions can be distinguished even when the sun is at elevations close to the zenit, e.g. at 87° (R. Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1999a). At dusk and dawn, birds may use the polarization pattern of the light to determine the direction. But this is still a matter of open research (Muheim 2011). 5.2 Star compass Sauer (1957) showed with experiments in the planetarium that birds use the stars for orientation. Indigo Buntings Passerina cyanea reversed their preferred direction in orientation experiments in a planetarium when the northern stars were reflected to the south (Emlen 1967). Birds use the stars, like the sun, as a compass. That is, they can determine a direction from the stars but they are not able to read a position from them (true navigation). In contrast to the sun compass, the star compass is independent of the internal clock. Birds need to have the ability to observe the sky before they can use the star compass. Emlen (1970) raised birds in a planetarium that rotated around an arbitrary star. These birds, when tested during migration, moved away from this star which they mistook for the rotation center. Further experiments showed that only the learned rotation center matters. There is no innate map of stars (R. Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1999a). Also, migratory birds recalibrate their star compass along their migratory route based on the magnetic compass. This is important because the star pattern change when migrating along the north-south axis. 5.3 Magnetic compass The magnetic field seems to play a key role in the orientation of migratory birds. It looks like the birds’ innate migration direction is based on the magnetic field (R. Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1999b). That birds use the magnetic field to determine their migration direction has first been shown by Merkel and Wiltschko (1965). They tested European Robins Erithacus rubicula during spring migration in the natural magnetic field as well as in magnetic fields of which the horizontal and the vertical component respectively was reflected. Under both artificial magnetic fields the Robins preferred southern instead of northern directions. This and subsequent experiments revealed that birds can perceive the inclination angle of the magnetic field and that they are not sensitive to the direction of the field (W. Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1972). They use an inclination compass. The inclination compass is very precise: deviations of 2° from vertical can be perceived by birds in high Arctic zones (Muheim, Åkesson, and Alerstam 2003). The ability to perceive the magnetic field is present in many organisms. Behavioral and physiological studies on taxonomically diverse animals suggest the presence of two fundamentally different, independent magnetoreception mechanisms that detect different parameters of the Earth’s magnetic field (R. Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1995). A light-dependent magnetic compass detects the axial alignment of the magnetic field, and a ferromineral-based mechanism provides positional magnetic map information (Phillips, Jorge, and Muheim 2010). However, the receptors still remain to be identified. In birds, the magnetite based mechanism is localised in the nostrils, whereas the light-dependent mechanism is localised in the retina. The function of the light-dependent orientation mechanism depends on the wavelengths of the light the bird experiences (Muheim, Bäckman, and Åkesson 2002). Birds are better oriented in short wavelength environments. Further, the neural visual system is active when nocturnally migrating passerines perform magnetic orientation (Heyers et al. 2007). However under long wavelengths, Robins were oriented well with intact nostrils but they were disoriented if the nostrils were anesthetized (R. Wiltschko et al. 2011). This indicates that they may also be able to use their nostrils for magnetic orientation when the visual system is not able to do so. The light-dependent magnetoreception mechanism is based on radical pairs (Ritz, Adem, and Schulten 2000). Under some wavelengths, the retina produces pairs of radicals that either can spin parallel or in opposite directions. The ratio between the two spinning states depends on their orientation in the magnetic field. Therefore, birds seem to be able to “see” the magnetic field (Muheim et al. 2014). 5.4 Landmarks That birds use landmarks to find their nest or cache where they previously stored food has been shown at a local scale for several species (e.g. Duff et al. (1998)). It is very likely that also migratory birds use landmarks, particularly for navigation (see below). 5.5 Olfactory cues It has long been known that homing pigeons also use olfactory cues for finding the way home. There is recent evidence that also other bird species including migratory birds use smell for their orientation. Anosmic shearwaters have difficulties to find back to their colony after a foraging trip (Padget et al. 2017). Tracking Catbirds Dumetella carolinensis on their autumn migration showed that adult birds treated with zinc sulphate to produce anosmia were unable to show the same orientation as control adults, and instead reverted to a direction similar to that shown by juveniles making their first migration. Experimentally offsetting the magneto-receptors had no effect on the orientation of either adults or juveniles. These results suggest that olfactory sense may play a role in experience based migration in adult catbirds (Holland et al. 2009). The role of olfactory cues for the orientation on migration is subject to ongoing research. 5.6 Compass orientation vs. navigation Compass orientation is the ability to move in the correct direction. Clock-and-compass orientation is the ability to move in the correct direction for a specific time (distance) so that a specific goal is reached. Compass or clock-and-compass is also called “vector navigation”. True navigation is the ability to find a specific location of the world from any actual location, i.e. it involves the ability to identify the actual location and its relative position to the destination location. The difference between compass orientation and navigation has been shown in a famous displacement experiment by Perdeck (1958). He translo-ated more than 10000 Starlings Sturnus vulgaris that were on their autumn migration from the Netherlands to Switzerland. Subsequent ring recovery locations of these translocated birds differed between adults and juveniles. Adults were found back in the normal wintering area, whereas juveniles were found further south outside of their normal winter range but in the correct migration direction from the release location. Thus adults were able to compensate for the displacement and navigate to their correct winter range, whereas juveniles proceeded migration in the correct direction without compensating for the displacement. Migratory birds use different compass systems depending on the circumstances (Muheim, Åkesson, and Alerstam 2003). The different orientation systems can be used in parallel, hierarchically or to calibrate each other. The interplay of the different systems is very complex and yet not fully understood. Further reading on orientation: The state of the knowledge on orientation at that time is nicely summarized and reviewed by R. Wiltschko and Wiltschko (1999a)]. A more recent review with focus on the interplay between the different compass systems and the ontogeny of orientation is given in the book by Hansson and Åkesson (2014). References Duff, S. J., L.

Normally, drag is around 1/10 of the weight. The more streamlined the body is the smaller the drag. Fast flying bird species are more streamlined (e.g. swifts) than slow flying species (e.g. pigeons). The wing is shaped as an aerofoil that produces lift when it is overflown by air. Birds produce both thrust and lift by flapping their wing. Among all forms of locomotion, flight is the one that requires most energy per unit of time. However, per unit of distance it is often quite efficient. Flight at low speeds is power demanding because wings have to be flapped at high speed in order to provide the lift to counteract gravity. At higher speeds, lift produced by the aerofoil shape of the wing increases without having to flap the wings. However, at even higher speed the profile and parasite drag increase so that higher speed need more power. The power vs. speed relationship, therefore, typically is U-shaped. Its minimum is at the speed at which the bird can fly with minimal power (minimum power speed). The greatest efficiency per unit of distance travelled is obtained at the maximum range speed, which is higher than the minimum power speed. These mechanics have implications for a migratory bird. Given a specific energy load (fat reserves), it can fly for the longest time if it flies at minimum power speed, but it covers longer distances if it flies at maximum range speed. Migratory birds may further minimize the time needed for migration, e.g. because it pays off having more time for other activities such as breeding or moulting, and therefore fly at even higher speeds. ## Warning: Paket &#39;afpt&#39; wurde unter R Version 4.2.3 erstellt Figure 6.1: Mechanical power of flight in relation to flight speed for a hypothetical Robin Erithacus rubecula. Minimum power speed is the speed at which the power curve reaches its minimum (speed at which horizontal line touches the power curve). At the maximum range speed the distance per energy used is maximal (speed at which the tangent from the origin touches the power curve). The power curve is calculated using the R-package afpt The relationship between mechanical flight power and speed depends on the morphology of the bird (Figure 6.1). Important factors are body mass, wing span and wing area. All else equal minimum power and maximal range speed increase with increasing body mass. Also body and wing shape play important roles. Seminal work on energetics of flight in birds has been done by Colins Pennycuick. He presents his life-long work in his book (Pennycuick 2008). Rayner (1990) gives a short introduction to flight mechanics wing morphology and migration performance. Anders Hedenström and his group investigate energetics of flight in migratory vertebrates, also including flapping flight (A. Hedenström and Alerstam 1998; Anders Hedenström 2009; Klein Heerenbrink, Johansson, and Hedenström 2015). They provide an R-package that allows exploring relationships between morphology and flight energetics (afpt). 6.2 Fuel for migratory flights Among the three types of fuel (glycogen, lipids, protein), lipids contain the highest amount of energy per storage weight and therefore, lipids constitute efficient fuel for migratory birds. However, extramuscular lipids need a 1-2 hour mobilization period before the energy delivery is fully operating and even then, the rate of delivery is limited by physiological constraints (perfusion limitation, insolubility in plasma). Therefore, in mammals the relative proportion of energy from lipids during endurance exercise is always low. In contrast, birds can increase the proportion of energy derived from lipids to over 90% during endurance flights. In addition to lipids, the contribution of proteins is around 5% (L. Jenni and Jenni-Eiermann 1998). The additional use of protein may be advantageous for the water metabolism. Further, when body weight decreases due to depletion of fat reserves, it may be energetically advantageous that the flight muscles shrink in parallel. 6.3 Influences on migration 6.3.1 Endogeneous and exogeneous factors How long birds stop-over is influenced by their body condition, food availability, time constraints and weather situation. Biebach (1985) caught Spotted flycatchers Muscicapa striata during their stop-over in an oasis of the Sahara desert. He deprived them from food and then allowed them restricted access to food and finally gave them food ad libitum. During the time with food deprivation, birds increased their migratory activity while body mass decreased. Migratory activity stopped when they received restricted access to food. During that period they increased body mass. Migratory activity started after they regained body mass. This experiment shows that birds decide between stopping-over and continuing migration based on their body condition and the food availability at the stop-over site. Tracking of Marsh harriers Circus aeruginosis for several subsequent migration seasons has shown that individuals are highly consistent in the timing of migration whereas they chose different migration routes every year (Vardanis et al. 2011). This suggests that the timing of migration is more strongly determined by genetics whereas the route may be chosen opportunistically depending on wind situation or food availability, at least in the Marsh harrier. 6.3.2 Topography Ecological barriers such as mountains, seas and deserts shape migration pattern. Most migrants choos routes side tracking ecological barriers. However, astoninglishly such barriers are regularly crossed by migrants. Individuals that cross the Alps, often are heavier and origin from more northern populations than individuals that fly around the Alps (Bruderer and Jenni 1988). Among the larger bird species regularly crossing the Alps, the ones normally using active flapping flight (e.g. falcons) predominate over those normally gliding by using thermal uplifts (e.g. storks). Migration density is lower above the Mediterranean compared to the Iberian Peninsula (Bruderer and Liechti 1998). Surprisingly, most birds crossing the Sahara desert only fly at night and rest over the day seeking a shadow place wherever they land (Schmaljohann, Liechti, and Bruderer 2007). 6.3.3 Wind Wind has a strong impact on migrating birds. The costs for migration may be doubled or halved depending on wind condition. Some migrants rely on wind drift for completing their migration. Migrants start when wind conditions are favorable. During flight they choose the height at which they experience tail wind (Felix Liechti 2006). How strongly birds compensate for wind drift depends on age and differs between species. Generally, weak wind drift is compensated, whereas strong wind drift is only partially compensated. 6.3.4 Temperature Temperature is important in two ways: First, temperature affects the migrating bird in flight. Second, temperature (together with other weather variables) acts via spatio-temporal distribution of food availability on the timing of migration. During flight, the bird has to cope with the body heat that is produced by the exercising muscles. This becomes more difficult at higher temperature. In wind tunnels, birds do not fly if temperatures are above 25°C. However, this contrasts with the observation of many birds flying at temperature above 25°C when crossing the Sahara desert during migration (Schmaljohann, Bruderer, and Liechti 2008). We still do not understand how birds cope with water loss and high temperature during migratory flights. Temperature affects vegetation and the onset of spring. Effects of global warming on the timing of migration have primarily been studied during spring migration. Based on capturing data at three different ringing stations in Northern America, Marra et al. (2005) showed that long-distance migrants migrate earlier in warm springs compared to cold springs, thereby 1°C warmer corresponded to 1 day earlier migration. However, the vegetation budburst advanced by 3 days, thus showed the three-fold reaction. They further showed that the speed of migration was faster in warm years compared to cold years. It seems as if long-distance migrants may be able to adjust their timing of spring migration to some limited extent to an earlier vegetation burst. Similarly, Both (2010) could show that Pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca adjusted the timing of spring migration rapidly to changing climate when conditions on migration are favorable. However, such adaptation of the timing happens not in all populations to a similar extent. Several studies found that conditions on the migratory route are important for the timing of migration (Hüppop and Winkel 2006). In general, short-distance migrants adapted their timing of migration to a higher degree than long-distance migrants. In the latter, timing seems to have a stronger genetic bases. Further, their migration is affected by changing conditions across a wide geographic range.

For instance, we estimat-ed the number of (passerine) birds migrating between Europe and Africa to be impressive 2.1. billion individuals (Hahn, Bauer, and Liechti 2009)! To cross the Sahara on their way to Africa, they need the energy of 34’000 tons of insects, 36’000 tons of fruit and 2’000 tons of seeds. If we consider migrants more generally, i.e. beyond birds, we find that migrants transport nutrients, energy, and other organisms (including seeds, mollusks, parasites, and pathogens) between disparate locations. Migrants also forage and are preyed upon throughout their journeys, thereby establishing transport and trophic interactions with resident communities. Migratory animals thus couple ecological communities across the globe and may mediate their diversity and stability. However, as yet, the influ-ence of migrants and their services on these communities is often overlooked, and as a consequence of global changes, migrations are threatened worldwide. Figure 7.1: Schematic overview of the interactions between migrants and the multiple resident communities they visit during their annual or life-cycles. At one specific site, migrants bring with them nutrients and energy but also (propagules of) other organisms including parasites accumulated on earlier sites. The migrants’ input and state embodies carry-over effects of conditions on earlier sites which importantly determine their interactions with a resident community (orange arrows): demographic rates of resident populations (species) can be directly changed (straight arrows) as, e.g., nutrients and energy are imported, but also indirectly(dashed arrows) as the transmission of parasites and any introduced species establish competitive interactions with residents. From (S. Bauer and Hoye 2014) Through these transport and trophic effects, migrants interact with resident communities. For instance, they may uniquely alter energy flow, food-web topology and stability, trophic cascades, and the struc-ture and dynamics of (meta-)communities. For example, the inputs of nutrients and energy originating from distant localities by migrants can dramatically increase resource availability, with rippling conse-quences for productivity at various trophic levels and the potential to drive the transition between alter-native stable states. Migrant-mediated transport of propagules of other organisms can lead to the es-tablishment of new or lost species, as well as influencing gene fl ow and genetic mixing among resident populations. Similarly, migrants can alter parasite transmission, diversity, and evolution by harboring a broader range of parasites than residents and by either facilitating or hindering the longdistance dis-persal of parasites. Foraging by migrants can also have profound effects on community processes and ecosystem functions. For instance, grazing by migratory animals can alter nutrient cycling, primary productivity, biomass of edible plants, competitive interactions between plant species, and ultimately, the composition and long-term persistence of the entire plant community. The most striking difference between migrant and resident consumers is, however, the pulsed nature of migrant utilization and the timing of their interactions. Together, these fundamentally defi ne the relationship between migrant abundance and primary production (in the case of migrant herbivores) or the stability of food webs (in the case of migratory predators). Figure 7.2: Schematic overview of the interactions between migrants and the multiple resident communities they visit during their annual or life-cycles. At one specific site, migrants bring with them nutrients and energy but also (propagules of) other organisms including parasites accumulated on earlier sites. The migrants’ input and state embodies carry-over effects of conditions on earlier sites which importantly determine their interactions with a resident community (orange arrows): demographic rates of resident populations (species) can be directly changed (straight arrows) as, e.g., nutrients and energy are imported, but also indirectly(dashed arrows) as the transmission of parasites and any introduced species establish competitive interactions with residents. From (S. Bauer and Hoye 2014) The highly predictable, seasonally pulsed nature of animal migration, together with the spatial scales at which it operates and the immense number of individuals involved, not only set migration apart from other types of movement, but render it a uniquely potent, yet underappreciated, dimension of biodiversity that is intimately embedded within resident communities. Given the potential for migration to influ-ence ecological networks worldwide, we suggest integrative network approaches, through which stud-ies of community dynamics and ecosystem functioning may explicitly consider animal migrations, understand the ramifications of their declines, and assist in developing effective conservation measures. 7.2 Animal migrations provide services and disservices It is increasingly recognized that migrating organisms have ecological effects on resident communities and ecosystems (see above), and these can represent a multitude of services and disservices that are relevant to human infrastructure, agriculture and welfare. Services provided by migrant animals comprise economic benefits in the order of billions of dollars annually; likewise, their disservices and human-wildlife conflicts (e.g. bird-aircraft collisions) produce significant costs, both economically, and in terms of human and animal lives (Allan &amp; Orosz 2001; Marra et al. 2009). Migrations involve immense numbers of individuals and constitute massive shifts of biomass that influence communities and ecosystems through the transport of nutrients, energy or other organisms, and through trophic interactions (see above). The sheer presence of migrants may raise human-wildlife conflicts; their transport and trophic effects may be essential and economically beneficial yet can also pose health risks or inflict damage. Examples of the multitude of highly-desirable services include Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida braziliensis), which consume large quantities of migrant moths such as corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea) – one of the most important agricultural pests in North America (Boyles et al. 2011). Migratory bats have also long been acknowledged for their pollination services of, e.g. columnar cacti and agave, that play vitally important roles in the plants’ fruit production (Fleming &amp; Valiente-Banuet 2002; Kunz et al. 2011). Similarly, migratory birds can enhance the dispersal of plant seeds or small invertebrates and thus, increase the genetic exchange between (fragmented) populations and potentially assist with ecosystem recovery (van Leeuwen et al. 2012; Viana et al. 2016). Among other ecosystem services, migratory bogong moths (Agrotis infusa) are an important food source for wildlife and aboriginal people in Australia (Green 2011). Although the overall economic benefit of these services is difficult to estimate, the value of, e.g., Brazilian free-tailed bats to the agricultural industry in terms of crop damage avoided and reduction in pesticide use amounts to billions of dollars per year (Boyles et al. 2011). In contrast to these services, migrants can also directly inflict harm or damage, either by feeding on crops or by affecting important ecosystem functions. For instance, a square km sized swarm of locusts (e.g. Schistocerca gregaria) contains about 40 million individuals that will eat the same amount of food per day as about 35,000 people link. Similarly, many migratory goose populations have thrived over the past decades and their foraging is increasingly causing conflicts with agriculture and raising concern for the functioning of their Arctic breeding grounds as a global carbon sink (Van Der Wal et al. 2007). Another harmful effect of migrants is their role in the long-distance transport of parasites and pathogens of plants, animals, and humans (e.g. Reynolds et al. 2006; Altizer et al. 2011; Dao et al. 2014; Chapman et al. 2015): Many insects are not only agricultural pest species per se but vector a variety of plant viruses, e.g. Rhopalosiphum padi aphids vector barley yellow dwarf virus. Also bats may carry agents of serious human diseases, e.g. the recent Ebola outbreak in Western Africa originated from migratory straw-colored fruit-bats (Eidolon helvum) (Peel et al. 2013); and finally, migratory birds have regularly been blamed for spreading pathogens such as avian influenza virus, West Nile virus or other disease vectors (e.g. Tian et al. 2015). The often immense numbers of migrants may create serious human-wildlife conflicts: For instance, the annual costs of bird collisions with aircraft are up to $1.2 billion worldwide (Allan &amp; Orosz 2001) – a widely publicized example being US Airway flight 1549 which made an emergency landing on the Hudson River after colliding with a flock of geese (Marra et al. 2009). Collisions with manmade structures such as power lines, wind turbines, or towers can disrupt their normal functioning and kill large numbers of birds and bats annually, but there is great variation in estimates of costs, fatalities and their ecological significance (Cryan et al. 2014). Thus, many stakeholders may be interested in monitoring, understanding and forecasting the large-scale movements of animal migrants, some of which are depicted in Fig. 7.3. Figure 7.3: A variety of stakeholders can benefit from better using the services of aerial migrants, reducing their disservices and mitigating human-wildlife conflicts – a few of which are exemplarily depicted in the outer images.

"],["global-change-and-other-challenges.html", "Chapter 8 Global change and other challenges 8.1 Climate change 8.2 Sensory pollution 8.3 Man-made structures 8.4 Conservation of migrants and migrations", " Chapter 8 Global change and other challenges 8.1 Climate change There is good evidence that the timing of avian migrations is changing in response to climate change (e.g. James &amp; Abbott 2014; Gilroy et al. 2016). These changes may disrupt ecosystem functions if they result in broad mismatches between migration timing and the timing of seasonal productivity (Jones and Cresswell 2010). A more complete understanding of how migrants respond to environmental change would be useful for predicting impacts of climate change on migration systems, and how these may carry over to communities and ecosystems. Many studies have documented changes in migration phenology associated with climate change (Carey 2009, La Sorte et al. 2014b), yet large gaps remain in our understanding of migration phenology and its relationship to climate (Cohen et al. 2018). Substantial research effort has been invested in attempts to scale-up organism-focused research approaches to answer these questions. These attempts have used numerous methods such as massive bird banding efforts, broad-scale stable isotope and genetic sampling, and individual tracking studies (Hobson and Wassenaar 2008, Thorup et al. 2014). Particularly the latter often reveal spectacular migratory behaviours (e.g. Liechti et al. 2013b). Although valuable in their own context, all of these approaches fail to sample broadly and densely enough to support coherent system-level inferences about continental-scale migration systems. It would be desirable to have a measure of migration phenology that enables comparisons with existing phenology network data and individual migrant tracking data. Linking phenology across levels of biological organization from individuals to ecosystems through time and space would help us understand the scaling of biological impacts of climate change (Kelly and Horton 2016). A data-science research program centred on use of the weather surveillance radar archive could provide this inference. This approach offers key advantages, such as nearly continuous, continent-scale sampling, that make it capable of addressing the challenge of advancing our understanding of migration at the system-level (Kelly and Horton 2016). Automated workflows mine NEXRAD and other data archives to produce robust metrics for quantifying migration systems, which are scalable across time and space (Van Doren and Horton 2018). A key innovation is to capture the complexity of migration systems analysis while focusing on easily interpreted and universal metrics of migration systems: migratory intensity and migratory trajectory. Most of the diverse methods employed by organismal ecologists to study migration are motivated by efforts to measure these two parameters. Progress in this direction is occurring rapidly and it is likely that we will achieve this vision in North America by 2020. 8.2 Sensory pollution Globally, light pollution (ALAN) has increased dramatically during the 20th century (Falchi et al. 2016) and numerous aerial migrants from diverse taxa pass through photo-polluted skies annually (La Sorte et al. 2017, Cabrera-Cruz et al. 2018). ALAN represents a powerful stimulus, which could interfere with avian sensory systems such as the magnetic and celestial compasses, that can entrain attraction to and disorientation from light or avoidance of illuminated stopover habitat across diverse spatial scales (Van Doren et al. 2017, McLaren et al. 2018). While light pollution is not novel in the environment, it is still a relatively new stimulus from an evolutionary perspective. The possibility to measure light pollution globally using remote sensing enables scientists to study its relationships to behaviour and ecology from local to macroscales. ALAN’s effects can be disruptive (e.g. Winkler et al. 2014) or even deadly (Jones and Francis 2003), ranging from significant alterations of body condition, disruptions of life histories or increased mortality through collisions with structures (e.g. Gaston et al. (2013), and may depend on proximate situations in which birds experience this. Less is known about the impact of ALAN on insect and bat migrations, but negative effects, such as reductions in moth feeding behaviours (van Langevelde et al. 2017, Grubisic et al. 2018) and bat species diversity in urban areas (Ancillotto 2015), appear likely. Future research should elucidate ALAN-effects at local to continental scales, during different phases of the annual cycle and with respect to vertical and horizontal lights, ground-based and aerial-based light, and combined effects of light intensity, spectra, location, and atmosphere. Similar to artificial light, anthropogenic electromagnetic noise has reached unprecedented levels. Its effects on aerial migrants are largely unclear, although it has been demonstrated that, e.g. electromagnetic noise disrupts magnetic compass orientation in caged birds under laboratory conditions (Engels et al. 2014) and new research efforts are clearly needed. Large-scale radar studies spanning a range of urbanised and rural habitats could therefore test the ideas that anthropogenic light and electromagnetic noise represent insidious new threats to the survival of nocturnal migrants, by comparative analyses of large-scale migration patterns, individual flight behaviour and orientation performance under a range of carefully measured ALAN and electromagnetic noise levels at local to continental spatial scales and nightly to decadal temporal scales. 8.3 Man-made structures Collisions with man-made structures such as power lines, wind turbines, tall towers, masts and buildings kill large numbers of birds and bats annually, although there is great variation in estimates of fatalities and their ecological significance (Cryan et al. 2014, Lambertucci et al. 2014). However, for poorly-studied species such as migratory tree bats, mortality from wind turbines in North America appears to represent a substantial population-level threat (Frick et al. 2017b) and further research is urgently needed. Radar-based approaches have emerged as key tools to detect, monitor and counteract these effects (May et al. 2015, Fijn et al. 2015), and have been employed particularly in wind farms. Large-scale radar mapping of migration now allows careful spatial prioritization at the planning phase of wind turbine installations. Interestingly, when investigating effects of manmade structures, portable radars can complement and extend results from larger radar networks by increasing resolution locally as has been shown in studies of foraging behaviour and fine-scale variation in habitat use by bats around wind turbines (Cryan et al. 2014). The influence of man-made structures on insect migration and flight behaviour has been considerably less explored. But like responses to natural topographic features, insects may follow man-made linear structures and can accumulate in streams of air flowing downwind from wind turbines, buildings and other tall structures. Indirect evidence for such concentrating effects at wind farms comes from the attraction of foraging insectivorous bats to these sites (Cryan et al. 2014, Foo et al. 2017). Additionally, tall buildings can influence insect flight behaviour through effects on microclimate and sunlight availability but responses of migratory insects to urbanisation may differ from those of non-migratory insects (Luder et al. 2018). Figure 8.1: The major challenges in migration ecology cover long-standing and novel questions. Obviously, characterizing migration routes and timing and quantifying migrant numbers is fundamental to all other questions (central area). Understanding navigation and orientation as well as the influence of weather and climate on migrants and migrations is also fundamental to understanding how migrations are shaped and which consequences these have for (the abundance of) migrant populations (blue boxes). Among the most pertinent challenges are those that highlight the direct and indirect influences of human structures and actions on migrants as well as mitigation of human-wildlife conflicts or migrant disservices. For instance, sensory pollution through artificial light and noise can impact navigation and orientation and global climate changes can change the timing of migration. From (Silke Bauer et al. 2019). 8.4 Conservation of migrants and migrations The conservation of small, long-distance migrants such as songbirds, bats, and insects, and their migration systems, pose specific challenges (Runge et al. 2014). Migrants are dependent on multiple, potentially scattered or fragmented stopover sites (Fraser et al. 2012). Continental monitoring systems based on weather radar networks (Chilson et al. 2012b, Shamoun-Baranes et al. 2014) have emerged as one of the few techniques that can provide basic data on the use of specific habitats by large numbers of small passerine birds over very large spatial scales. For example, by examining spatial variation in dusk departure activity of nocturnal songbird migrants along the eastern seaboard of the USA (which reflects stopover decisions from the cessation of migration the previous night), Buler and Dawson (2014) demonstrated the huge importance of highly-localised floodplain hardwood forests for migratory passerines. Continuous, large-scale monitoring using weather radar also has a great potential in mapping key areas for some bat species (Chilson et al. 2012b) as well as sites and routes important for migrating moths and butterflies (Stefanescu et al. 2013, Krauel et al. 2015). Such information is invaluable for the prioritization of conservation measures in migratory systems, where actions in one location are likely to affect the situation at other locations along the route, especially across international borders (López-Hoffman et al. 2017). Establishing migratory patterns and the relative importance of paths and stopover sites emerges as more important than ever for conservation now that the connectedness of migratory populations becomes evident (Fraser et al. 2012). Migrants are likely to face difficulties adapting their migration strategies to keep up with a changing climate (Schmaljohann and Both 2017). Establishing the key stopover sites to ensure the long-term conservation of systems with migrating birds, bats, butterflies and moths is therefore a key challenge for radar aeroecology in years to come. However, securing the key sites on the ground may not be enough. The airspace connecting them is a central part of aerial migration systems and the concept of aerial protected areas, similar to marine protected areas, has recently emerged as a promising new tool to protect bird, bat and insect migration systems (Chilson et al. 2012a, Diehl 2013, Davy et al. 2017). Future efforts are therefore needed to explicitly add a vertical, airspace dimension to the conservation of long-distance migrants.

In 1899 he, for the first time, marked Starlings Sturnus vulgaris with aluminium rings that were uniquely numbered and contained an address to make a potential finder reporting the ring (Mortensen 1901). Motivated by the success of Mortensen, the first ringing station was initiated in Rossiten (today Rybachi) on the Kurische Nehrung in 1900. Shortly after, other ringing stations were started on Helgoland and in the UK. Today, around 5 million birds are ringed annually at many ringing stations by professional and private ringers in Europe (Balmer et al. 2008). The ring numbers are coordinated within the countries by the governments who normally delegate this job to ringing schemes. The European ringing schemes are connected within the EURING society. In regular meetings and workshops, methodological standards are developed and the EURING data base, a data pool of all marking and reencounter data, maintained. EURING also started the EURING Analytical meeting that serves as a network of scientists developing statistical and mathematical tools for the analysis of mark-reencounter data. The capturing and marking methods underly national policies. In Switzerland, only trained persons can apply for a permission for capturing and marking birds. Mark-reencounter data is widely used to estimate survival, population sizes, movement pattern, migratory connectivity, and stop-over durations. Du Feu et al. (2016) review the scientific achievements of bird ringing, present the aims and policies of the EURING data base and give perspectives of bird ringing. A central challenge in the interpretation of mark-reencounter data is the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of reencounter probability (Perdeck 1977; Fränzi Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2010; Thorup et al. 2014). Mark-recapture modelling techniques such as the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model (Cormack 1964; Jolly 1965; Seber 1965), the multi-state model (Arnason 1972; Arnason, Schwarz, and Gerrard 1991) or mark-dead recovery model (Brownie et al. 1985), are seminal techniques that are nowadays widely applied and integrated in a variety of different ecological models. These models estimate reencounter probability and thereby account for its heterogeneity while interpreting mark-reencounter data. Many countries published their mark reencounters in migration atlases, e.g. Bønløkke et al. (2006), and Saurola, Valkama, and Velmala (2013). Examples of quantifying migratory connectivity studies based on ring reencounters: Estimation of the proportions of some song bird species migrating to Africa (Thorup and Conn 2009). Origin of Woodcocks hunted in France (Bauthian et al. 2007). Migratory connectivity of European Nightingales Luscinia megarhynchos (Fränzi Korner-Nievergelt, Liechti, and Hahn 2012) Migratory connectivity of European reed warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus (Petr Procházka et al. 2017). For estimating survival, it makes a fundamental difference whether the marked animal is found dead or whether it is resighted or recaptured alive. When it is found dead the time of death and thus the lifespan of the individual is known. If we assume that the probability that a dead animal is found and its mark reported is independent of its age, then annual survival estimates are straight foreward. For example, using dead recoveries of 8 different songbird species ringed in Denmark, Lerche-Jørgensen et al. (2018) found that early arriving long-distance migrants in spring have a lower survival compared to late arriving individuals whereas arrival date was not correlated with survival in short-distance migrants. Interestingly, female long distance migrants arrived in average at a date correlated with highest survival, whereas males arrived earlier thereby risking an increase in mortality. When marked animals are recaptured and released alive or resighted, the exact time of death is not known but a minimum life-span is known. In order to estimates survival from such data, it is necessary to estimate recapture or resighting probability (reencounter probability). If reencounter probability is known we can estimate the probability that an individual is still alive dependent on the time after its last reencounter. The CJS model allows estimating both reencounter and (apparent) survival probability. However, because both dead individuals and individuals that emigrated from the study area can no longer be reencountered, the model cannot distinguish between emigration and death. Therefore, the “survival” estimates from mark-recapture/resighting data have to be interpreted as the probability that an individual stays in the study area and survives, the so called apparent survival. Example studies: Sillett and Holmes (2002) estimated lower apparent survival during migration compared to the breeding and non-breeding periods in the Black-throated blue warbler Dendroica caerulescens. In the central Apennine, female White-winged snowfinches Montifringilla nivalis disappear at a higher rate in years with warm and dry summers, whereas the apparent survival of males does not seem to depend on summer weather (Strinella et al. 2020). 9.3 Tracking individuals The vision of being able to follow a migratory bird on a computer screen has become, at least for larger animals, reality by now. Geographic position, flight altitude and other variables can be measured within short time and related to individual characteristics. Two major principles exist for tacking devices. Archival tags store information on geographic position or anything else locally and the tracking device needs to be retrieved to access this information. In contrast, transmitters actively transmit information to a receiver such that data can be remotely downloaded (Table 9.2). The development of tracking devices is ongoing intensively. Devices become smaller, energy households more efficient, type of measurements more diverse and programming more flexible. Table 9.2: Characteristics of different tracking techniques. Adapted from Robinson et al. (2010). Tag type Data Pros and cons Archival tags Geolocators Light and time +:light weight (0.5 - 1.5g), recapturing required; -:data analyses complex, location estimate with large error range (equinox) Multi-sensor loggers light and time temperature pressure activity +:additional information such as flight height, activity, etc., combination of data for better location estimation; -:recapturing necessary GPS loggers GPS position temperature pressure activity salinity +:huge amount of information, precise location information; -:recapturing necessary, relatively heavy Transmitters PTT tags, RFID Radio frequency identification identification of an individual with a reader at a strategic place (nest, feeding site) +:low cost, small and leight-weigt (sometimes implanted); -:readers are expensive, individual is registered only when it is close to the reader (data are often noisy) Radio telemetry, VHF very high frequency telemetry identification of an individual by an antenna over short to medium long distances (0-ca. 20km) +:remote data collection, can be very light (0.3g), precise location information; -:battery life limited for small transmitters, high effort for data collection Satellite telemetry, e.g. ARGOS GPS position of individuals at any time anywhere on the globe +:remote data collection via satellite over very long distances, almost no effort needed for data collection, precise location information; -:large weight, expensive The Motus project is a world wide radio telemetry collaboration. Antennas around the world register radio tagged animals and send the information to the researchers. The movebank data base is collecting tracking data from different studies. Its aim is to foster collaboration between different researchers. Some of the data are even provided for free. Example studies using geolocation: Non-breeding areas of Barn swallows Hirundo rustica (Felix Liechti et al. 2014). Migration pattern in relation to ecological barriers: (Hahn et al. 2014). -Effects of geolocation on behaviour and body condition: Geolocators that weighted more than 2.3% of the body mass of tracked bird negatively influenced return rates in waders (Weiser et al. 2016). Example studies using radio telemetry: Bächler and Schaub (2006) estimated stop-over durations in an oasis of the Sahara using mark-resighting data and compared these estimates with stop-over durations measured using radio telemetry. At an Alaskan stop-over site,Schmaljohann et al. (2013) studied the effect of fuel load and weather on stop-over duration of the Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe. The first animal that was tracked by radio telemetry was a Grizzly bear Ursus horribilis (Craighead and Craighead 1972). Example studies of satellite telemetry: Kjellén, Hake, and Alerstam (1997) tracked two Ospreys Pandion haliaetus from the same breeding location. The two individuals used completely different migration routes. The technique is nowadays widely applied for the study of movement behaviour of larger birds. 9.4 Orientation experiments Kramer (1949) detected that migratory birds show a directional preference. This behaviour has widely been used to study bird orientation using orientation cages. Emlen and Emlen (1966) designed an orientation cage that is still in use, the so-called “Emlen-funnel”. Originally, ink was used to visualize the birds tracks. The ink was replaced by typewriter paper on which birds leave scratches while their feathers stayed clean. Some methodological issues with this type of orientation cage are discussed by Nievergelt and Liechti (2000). After typewriter paper has no longer been produced it was recently replaced by thermal paper (H. Mouritsen et al. 2009). Automatic registration of bird activity reduces the amount of work for data collection, e.g. Henrik Mouritsen and Larsen (2001) or Beck and Wiltschko (1983). 9.5 Stable isotopes, genetics and physiology Stable isotopes indicate humidity and reflect trophic levels of the diet during the time when the bird’s feathers grew. In America, the isotopic map shows a north-south gradient (Hobson and Wassenaar 2008). Hobson et al. (2012) developed a isotopic map for Africa that may serve as a basis for studying bird migration and non-breeding ecology. However, geographic information in isotopes is weak. Isotopes measure chemical composition of the diet and may better be interpreted as such (Hahn et al. 2013). For extracting geographic information, often additional data is needed. For example, P. Procházka et al. (2013) combined ring reencounters with isotopes to describe a migratory divide in the Reed warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus. When populations differ genetically, the DNA of individuals at stop over or non-breeding sites can reveal their breeding origins. The analysis of mtDNA showed that Dunlins Calidris alpina observed in Portugal during migration originated from Greenland, Iceland and the Baltic Sea whereas the ones staying over winter had haplotypes of populations further to the east (Lopes, Marques, and Wennerberg 2006). The study of metabolites in blood samples revealed that birds use lipids and proteins as energy fuel for endurance flights. In a review, Jenni-Eiermann and Jenni (2012) describe how the proportion of protein used is related to the duration of fastening, such as during a long migratory flight. 9.6 References References Arnason, A.

"],["migration-models.html", "Chapter 10 Migration models 10.1 State-dependent migration models", " Chapter 10 Migration models A variety of modelling approaches exist that investigate entire migrations or parts of it: simple analytical models, game-theoretic models, dynamic optimisation models (also known as stochastic dynamic pro-gramming models, SDP), individual-(or agent) based models (IBM), physical transport models, models based on evolutionary programming, network models and others. These models should not be con-fused with statistical analyses of migration, which may also yield predictive models but are not based on (assumed or hypothesised) mechanisms underlying migration. The models differ in their level of complexity and the assumptions they make, and the choice of a particular modelling approach should always be guided by the scientific questions that need to be tackled. For instance, to identify the rea-sons why birds migrate at night, a very general conceptual model is best suited (see below) while for specific predictions of the distribution of a migratory population, a spatio-temporally explicit approach will be required. Examples for models that aim at explaining specific migration behaviours and/or patterns are: - Kokko et al. (2006) explored reasons for the earlier arrival of males in the breeding area ob-served in many migratory bird species. They found that territoriality cannot explain this protan-dry because this affects both males and females. However, if early arriving males can increase their chance of mating whereas females cannot, arrival time of only males advanced. - Alerstam &amp; Hedenström – The development of bird migration theory – which factor – time, en-ergy or safety determines migration patterns? (Alerstam &amp; Hedenström 1998) - Alerstam – why do birds fly detours (Alerstam 2001)? - Hein – what determines maximum migration distance (Hein et al. 2012)? In the following, we specifically introduce state-dependent migration models as they are a good trade-off between ‘conceptual’ and ‘realistic’ and may thus be used to investigate a variety of both fundamen-tal and applied ecological questions. 10.1 State-dependent migration models State-dependent optimality models calculate fitness-maximizing decisions depending on time, and a set of state-variables – in our case, location and body reserves. They use an optimization procedure (line-ar programming) that starts at the final time-point and calculates backwards the sequence of behav-ioural decision that would maximize fitness. The fundamental behavioural decisions a bird faces in each time-step in the model are a) to stay at its present location or b) to migrate to one of the following sites – each of which has consequences on the animal’s state (body reserves and location). Staying at the present location may allow foraging and accumulating fuel stores that are required for covering the next migratory step or for accumulating re-serves required for breeding. However, staying and foraging also entails mortality risks – as carrying body reserves may be costly and foraging may reduce vigilance (see below), and a time-cost when staying beyond the best time for arrival at the breeding grounds. Alternatively, flying to one of the fol-lowing sites may bring a bird closer to its breeding grounds and thus, facilitate arrival at the breeding grounds within the short time-window that allows successful breeding. However, if this ‘target-site’ does not provide food yet, staying there might increase starvation risk. Once the optimal decisions have been calculated for all possible combinations of time, body reserve levels and for all locations, forward simulations are run to generate predictions on individual birds dur-ing their journey from the wintering to breeding grounds. Data requirements. For model parameterisation, internal and external constraints (e.g. the costs of locomotion and food availability for all stopover sites) need to be known as well as how these change the values of state variables (e.g. how food availability affects body stores). Model predictions are ide-ally scrutinized by spatio-temporal explicit data of the population along the migratory route (e.g. count data) or individual migration data from tracking studies. Elaborate background and methodology on state-dependent models can be found in the excellent text-books of (Houston &amp; McNamara 1999, Clark &amp; Mangel 2000). State-dependent migration models have been used for a variety of questions; a few examples are the following: • Estimating the impact of global changes on stop-over site use (Bauer et al. 2008). • Managing migrant populations at lowest economic cost (Klaassen et al. 2008a). • Hunting migratory populations • Potential reasons for why red knots (Calidris canutus) use multiple routes to their breeding grounds (Bauer et al. 2010) • Besides birds, SDP models have also investigated the spawning migrations of cod assuming optimal energy allocations (Jørgensen &amp; Fiksen 2006, Jørgensen et al. 2008).

It is highly recommended to get an understanding of linear modelling in empirical sciences. Our course is not a statistics course, but we will use statistics for the group work during the course. As a preparation for the course, we recommend reading Chapters 2, 3 and 11 of the online book on linear modelling. 11.2 Distribution models for counts of resting or migrating individuals Count data are classically analysed using generalized linear (mixed) models (GLMM). Typically, the Poisson or negative-binomial models serve as a first model choice when the outcome variable is a count data. In most cases, depending on the data structures, these models are expanded by including spatial or temporal structures, accounting for an excess of zero values (zero-inflation) or a large variance (overdispersion). Any textbook introducing linear models, linear mixed models, generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models is recommended. We particularly like the introduction to hierarchical models by Gelman and Hill (2007). Of course, we also recommend our own introduction to linear models that follows the philosophy of Gelman and Hill but is written by ecologists for ecologists, i.e. less technically (F. Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015). An open access second edition of the most important parts of the book is available. Example studies that analysed count data for the study of bird migration: Distribution of migratory species during the non-breeding season within Africa (Wisz, Walther, and Rahbek 2007). 11.3 Migratory connectivity models Migratory connectivity is the extent to which breeding areas are connected with non-breeding areas via migrating individuals (Webster et al. 2002; S. Bauer and Hoye 2014). A (multidimensional) measure of migratory connectivity are the proportions of individuals from specific, predefined, breeding areas that spend the non-breeding season in specific, predefined, non-breeding areas. Thus, migratory connectivity can be quantified based on distinct breeding areas and distinct non-breeding areas. Alternatively, migratory connectivity may be visualised using different distribution maps by population (Schirmer 2021). Estimates of migratory connectivity can be obtained by tracking individuals from their breeding grounds to their non-breeding ground. However, because migratory connectivity is a characteristic of populations (not of individuals) a lot of individuals need to be tracked in order to get a reliable estimate of migratory connectivity. Therefore, reencounters of marked individuals that are often available for a large number of individuals and from many different populations are well suited to study migratory connectivity. However, the spatial heterogeneity of reencounter probability introduces a bias in the raw mark reencounter data. Stochastic models to correct for this bias have been developed by Kania and Busse (1987), Kendall, Conn, and Hines (2006), Bauthian et al. (2007) and Thorup and Conn (2009). The model has further been expanded by Fränzi Korner-Nievergelt, Liechti, and Hahn (2012), Cohen et al. (2014), F. Korner-Nievergelt, Liechti, and Thorup (2014) and Schirmer (2021). Combination of different data sources such as ring recoveries, GPS tracking data, geolocator data or stable isotopic data further improves the accuracy of the migratory connectivity estimates (Fränzi Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2017; Rönn et al. 2020a). 11.4 Estimating survival based on mark-recapture data: The Cormack-Jolly-Seber model To study population processes, individuals often are marked and later recaptured or re-sighted. Such mark-recapture/re-sight data contain information on demographic parameters such as survival, movement and population size. The difficulty with mark-recapture data is that not all marked individuals are recaptured during each capture occasion. If an individual has not been captured, it may have died, emigrated from the study area, or it may have escaped being captured. For the study of the demographic parameters it is important to disentangle capture probability from the parameters of interest. To do so, Cormack (1964), Jolly (1965), and Seber (1965) developed a statistical model, the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model (CJS), which became the method used by myriad population biologists (Lebreton et al. 1992; D. L. Thomson and al 2009). The software MARK has become a standard software for the analyses of mark-recapture data (White and Burnham 1999; Cooch and White 2016). The technique is still being developed for the study of various aspects of demographic processes by a lively society of ecologists and statisticians. Here, we introduce the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model for estimating apparent survival and recapture probability, or re-sighting probability in cases of re-sights, respectively. The correct term “apparent” survival expresses that in a mark-recapture/re-sight data set from one study site individuals that permanently emigrated from the study site cannot be distinguished from individuals that died. “Apparent” survival is a product of survival and site fidelity. The CJS model explicitly models the capture process (the observation process) conditional on a model for apparent survival (the biological process). By including an observation process model, the recapture probability and thus the proportion of individuals still alive and present but not recaptured is estimated and taken into account while estimating the probability that an individual survives and stays in the study area. For example, mark-recapture data of Reed warblers Acrocephaus scirpaceus at the constant ringing effort site (CES) in the Wauwilermoos (LU) can be presented as in Table 11.1. Table 11.1: Number of Reed warblers marked at Wauwilermoos per year of first capture and number of recaptured individuals thereof in the subsequent years. The capture occasion numbers are given in brackets behind the year numbers. Year of first capture n marked 2014 (2) 2015 (3) 2016 (4) 2017 (5) 2018 (6) 2013 (1) 107 13 7 4 5 1 2014 (2) 76 - 6 2 1 1 2015 (3) 65 - - 4 3 0 2016 (4) 54 - - - 7 2 2017 (5) 64 - - - - 3 The probability that an individual of all marked individuals released at occasion \\(k\\) is recaptured at occasion \\(t\\) is a function of apparent survival probability \\(\\phi_{t}\\) and recapture probability \\(p_t\\) (Table 11.2). The recapture probability \\(p\\) is the probability that an individual that is alive and present in the study area is captured. The model parameters (apparent survival \\(\\phi_t\\) and recapture probability \\(p_t\\)) can be estimated by fitting a multinomial model to the number of recaptured individuals at the different occasions. Such a multinomial model is fitted for each cohort of individuals released at the same occasion with the cell probabilities of Table 11.2. Table 11.2: . Multinomial cell probabilities of a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model. Note that the cell probabilities are formulated so that one release of a marked individual is resulting in one recapture at maximum. Therefore, the data in Table 11.1 need to be re-arranged so that every recapture becomes a new release of a marked bird (such re-arranged data is called an m-array). Occ 2 3 4 5 6 1 \\(\\phi_1p_2\\) \\(\\phi_1(1-p_2)\\phi_2p_3\\) \\(\\phi_1(1-p_2)\\phi_2(1-p_3)\\phi_3p_4\\) \\(\\prod_{t=2}^4(\\phi_{t-1}(1-p_t))\\phi_4p_5\\) … 2 0 \\(\\phi_2p_3\\) \\(\\phi_2(1-p_3)\\phi_3p_4\\) \\(\\phi_2(1-p_3)\\phi_3(1-p_4)\\phi_4p_5\\) … 3 0 0 \\(\\phi_3p_4\\) \\(\\phi_3(1-p_4)\\phi_4p_5\\) … 4 0 0 0 \\(\\phi_4p_5\\) … 5 0 0 0 0 \\(\\phi_5p_6\\) The original CJS model allows estimating apparent survival and recapture probability separately for each time period except for the last time period. For the last time period, only the product \\(\\phi_{t-1}p_t\\) is estimable. More stringent model assumptions, such as constant survival over time or relating apparent survival to a linear predictor can give separate apparent survival and recapture estimates also for the last time period. The CJS model can alternatively be formulated as a partially hidden Markov model, and fitted to individual capture histories. Individual based model formulations are appealing because they allow including individual specific predictors and accounting for more complex correlation structures. The individual based model formulation consists of two logistic regressions, i.e. two Bernoulli-models. The first Bernoulli variable is the partially observed indicator \\(z_{it}\\) that indicates whether individual \\(i\\) is alive and present at time \\(t\\): \\(z_{it} \\sim Bernoulli(z_{it-1}\\phi_{it})\\) In other words, an individual \\(i\\) is alive and in the study area at time \\(t\\) (\\(z_{it} = 1\\)) with probability \\(\\phi_{it}\\), if it was alive and in the study area at time \\(t-1\\) (\\(z_{it-1} = 1\\)), or 0, if it was dead or had permanently emigrated from the study area at time \\(t-1\\) (\\(z_{it-1} = 0\\)). A linear predictor for the logit (or another link function) of \\(\\phi_{it}\\) can be added to study factors affecting apparent survival. This part of the model looks like an autoregressive logistic regression. However, the variable \\(z\\) is only partly observed. It is known that an individual is alive (\\(z_{it} = 1\\)) when it has been recaptured or resighted at time \\(t\\) (\\(y_{it} = 1\\)) or at any time point later. When an individual is not recaptured (\\(y_{it} = 0\\)) during any subsequent capture occasion, we do not know whether it has died or emigrated, or whether it is still alive but has not been captured or resighted. The capture process is added to the model as a second Bernoulli process. \\(y_{it} \\sim Bernoulli(z_{it}p_{it})\\) Also, a linear predictor can be added for the logit of \\(p_{it}\\) to study factors affecting the capture probability. Software that provide algorithms for fitting CJS models: MARK R-package marked CRAN, example in a group work of this course (Laake, Johnson, and Conn 2013) Stan, chapter 14.5 in F. Korner-Nievergelt et al. (2015) BUGS: WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, Jags. Chapter 7 in Kéry and Schaub (2012). E-Surge. Choquet, Rouan, and Pradel (2009). 11.5 Multi-state models to estimate movement rates Multi-state models are used for analysing changes between different states of animals. If the states are defined to be locations, a multi-state model analyses movements between different locations. The central parameters of such models are the probabilities that an animal moves from location A to location B between two time points. Multi-state models have been introduced by Arnason (1972) and Schwarz, Schweigert, and Arnason (1993). They have later been used by many authors for a variety of different study questions. With a large number of locations, the number of possible movements, and thus the number of model parameters, becomes very large and a very high sample size is needed to estimate all parameters. But for some model formulations, even with a very high sample size, some parameters may not be identifiable (Brownie et al. 1993; Gimenez, Choquet, and Lebreton 2003; King and Brooks 2003). Antoniazza, Korner-Nievergelt, and Keller (2012) used a multi-state model to describe the migration of juvenile and adult cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo that were colour marked at Lake Neuchatel during the breeding seasons. 11.6 Individual based hidden Markov model for bird behaviour Individual based hidden Markov models are used for analysing tracking data such as geolocator data or satellite telemetry data. Such data contain for each individual location measurements repeated at regular time intervals over a longer time span. Normally a measurement error is involved in the location measurement. For example, spatial error in a location measurement by light-based geolocation can be up to 1000 km (Lisovski et al. 2012) e.g. because of shading by clouds or vegetation. The individual based hidden Markov models assume that each individual has a (hidden) “true” location at each time interval, and that the recorded locations are measurements of the true locations with a measurement error. Both the true location as well as the measurement error can depend on environmental and/or individual characteristics. Therefore, the model can be used to estimate the true locations of the individuals over the time. Further, general patterns of migration can be studied, e.g. factors that influence migration speed, directions or decisions to depart on a migratory flight. A seminal paper that introduces these models for the study of seal migration is Jonsen, Flemming, and Myers (2005). The textbook by Hooten et al. (2017) give an understandable introduction to animal movement modelling. 11.7 The combination of different data sources In future, we expect that more ornithologists combine different data sources in formal models, the integrated models (e.g. Fränzi Korner-Nievergelt et al. (2017)). Bayesian techniques and user-friendly Bayesian software such as BUGS and Stan made these techniques available for ecologists. 11.8 References References Antoniazza, M., F.

We have compiled a list of suggested projects (see below) but students may come up with their own suggested project within the realm of bird and migration ecology (in the latter case, please come back to us before the course). The projects should be pursued in groups of 2-4 students. During the last day of the course, we expect an oral presentation of approx. 10 min that should cover the project’s scientific background, approach, research aims, results and a discussion. Ideally, the presentation is held jointly by the members of each group but if, for various reasons, this is impossible, other options can be chosen. 12.1 Pre-requisite: Reading and assessing scientific publications The projects require that students get familiar with some background and/or recent developments in a specific research field by reading and summarizing a few papers. Here are a few tips that may serve as guidelines: Summarize the article Formulate the key message of the paper Summarize the approach used What is the general approach? How could you characterize the model? Which are the important variables and why? Which scenarios were run? Make your own assessment of the articles Was it a convincing article? Was the approach appropriate to study the research question? Are the results supported by the data, argumentation or other information? Do you have questions that you would like to discuss with colleagues or experts? 12.2 Student project 1: Phenology - Migration timing within the season and their changes over the years Phenology characterises the temporal course of migration. Naturally, phenology has different aspects, e.g. how individuals of a species migrate in a particular season (spread-out or synchronized), how do migration pattern vary between seasons (e.g. spring and autumn migration), how do different species vary in their timing of migration (which species migrate late, which early), how much has the timing of migration (of a specific species) changed over the years, etc. You may use one or more of the above questions as a starting point and develop your project from them. The following papers may be inspiring to start with: Lukas Jenni and Kéry (2003), Hanmer, Boersch-Supan, and Robinson (2022) The project may include the following steps: Select a study species or species group Characterise the migration patterns that are relevant to your question, ideally from different angles (mean migration date, variance, etc.) Link the timing of migration to ecological variables, e.g. migration route, ecological characteristics of a species, etc. Time permitting, link the timing of migration to environmental variables, e.g. NDVI Data required and R-analyses passage_by_spec_year.txt: Median passage day per year and species species_data.rda: ecological characteristica of species You may use the following R-code to get started. dat &lt;- read.table(&quot;data/passage_by_spec_year.txt&quot;, header=TRUE, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;) # $ species : species nr = &quot;artnr&quot; in datspec # $ year : # $ mpassage : median passage day (day of year) # $ min_passage: first passage day # $ q10_passage: 10% quantile of passage day # $ q20_passage: 20% quantile of passage day # $ q80_passage: 80% quantile of passage day # $ q90_passage: 90 % quantile of passage day # $ max_passage: last passage day # $ n : number of individuals load(&quot;data/species_data.rda&quot;) # load data.frame &quot;datspec&quot; # species names and characteristics of species------------------------- # artnr: species number, see species data file # latabk: abreviation of latin species name # englname: english species name # Weight: g # FlightSpeed: m/s # WingSpan(m): m # WingArea(m2): m2 # DistanceBretolet_meanOrigi:n distance between Bretolet (ringing site) # and centre of species breeding distribution # Destination: non-breeding area # diet_breeding_season: diet during the breeding season: # Samen=seeds, Ins=insects, Pfl=plants # diet_migration: diet during the breeding season: # Samen=seeds, Ins=insects, Pfl=plants # habitat_breeding: Feld=field, Sumpf=marsh, Wasser=water, # Wald=forest, offener Wald=open forest, Luft=air, # Busch=bush, Gras=gras, Schilf=reed, Conif=coniferous forest # habitat_winter: Feld=field, Sumpf=marsh, Wasser=water, Wald=forest, # offener Wald=open forest, Luft=air, Busch=bush, Gras=gras, # Schilf=reed, Conif=coniferous forest # migratory_activity: n= nocturnal migrant, t=diurnal migrant, # t+n= migrates both at night and day # migdist_cat: l=long-distance migrant, k=short-distance migrant # Passeres: 0= non-Passeriformes, 1=Passeriformes # Example 1: Standard deviation of median passage day across years for the Robin sd(dat$max_passage[dat$species==4000]) ## [1] 7.416627 # Example 2: long-term change in median passage day for the Robin index &lt;- dat$species==4000 plot(dat$year[index], dat$mpassage[index], xlab=&quot;Year&quot;, ylab=&quot;Median passage day&quot;, main=&quot;Robin&quot;) mod &lt;- lm(mpassage~year, data=dat[index,]) abline(mod) newdat &lt;- data.frame(year=1976:2018) newdat$lwr &lt;- predict(mod, newdata=newdat, interval=&quot;confidence&quot;)[,2] newdat$upr &lt;- predict(mod, newdata=newdat, interval=&quot;confidence&quot;)[,3] lines(newdat$year, newdat$lwr, lty=3) lines(newdat$year, newdat$upr, lty=3) 12.3 Student project 2: Long-term changes in morphology Which morphological measure is relevant to migration or other life-history processes? Wing length is obviously an important determinant of flight costs. Has wing length changed over the years in specific species? Are there patterns, e.g. in short- and long-distance migrants? How could this pattern be explained, i.e. which processes or constraints may play a role? The following papers give some background on relevance: - Hahn et al. (2016) - Salewski, Hochachka, and Fiedler (2010) Data required and R-analyses Analyse species-specific ringing lists Select a morphological measure Analyse their summary statistics over the years, separately for species, sexes, etc. # the ring list will be distributed by the course leaders 12.4 Student project 3: Differential Migration Do young and old birds or males and females migrate at different times? If such sub-groups migrate at different times in specific species, what could explain these patterns? Potential study species and questions: age-differences in reed warblers age- and sex-differences in chaffinches. Analyse species-specific ringing lists Lerche-Jørgensen et al.

(2017) # the ring list will be distributed by the course leaders 12.5 Student project 4: Flight energetics in the course of a night and over the season Analyse how fat reserves change over the night or day and over the season. Possible questions to be asked are: How far can birds fly with what fat reserves? How does wing shape and weight of the bird influence the energy needed for flight? Does expected energy expenditure per hour flight correspond to the decrease of fat reserves? What factors influence flight energy? # you will get the ring list to analyse how fat reserves # change over the night and over seasons # use the R-package afpt to answer questions like library(&#39;afpt&#39;) ## Warning: Paket &#39;afpt&#39; wurde unter R Version 4.2.3 erstellt # define myBird, use data of a robin myBird &lt;- Bird( massTotal = 0.015, wingSpan = 0.15, wingArea = 0.0085, name = &#39;Robin&#39;, name.scientific = &#39;Erithacus rubecula&#39;, type = &#39;passerine&#39;, source = &#39;gestimated by fk&#39; ) speed &lt;- seq(3,18,length.out=10) # airspeed in m/s powercurve &lt;- computeFlappingPower(myBird,speed) par(mar=c(3.1,3.1,0.4,1.1),mgp=c(1.9,0.7,0.0),cex=0.75) with(powercurve , plot( speed,power, type=&#39;b&#39;, pch=15, col=&#39;grey20&#39;, xlab=NA, ylab=NA, xlim=c(0,18), ylim=c(0,1.1))) mtext(side = 1, line = 2,&#39;Speed (m/s)&#39;) mtext(side = 2, line = 2,&#39;Power (J/s)&#39;) abline(h=min(powercurve$power), col=grey(0.6)) abline(0,0.033, col=grey(0.8)) 12.6 Student project 5: Estimate survival from capture-recapture data Marking and recapturing individual birds allows for estimating apparent survival probability (= the probability that a bird survives and returns to the breeding site). Do survival probabilities correlate with conditions in the wintering area? Analyse a mark-recapture data set of reed warblers from a constant ringing effort site or from Snowfinches ringed year-round in the Alps. An introduction on how survival is estimated based on mark-recapture data is given during the second course day. 12.7 Student project 6: Modelling spring migration: several questions Read Chapter Migration Models for background on state-dependent migration models, what they can do and what they can’t. Exemplary questions that could be tackled with such a model are: Long-term changes in migration phenology - which site conditions make animals change their migration timing? What are the consequences of climate-driven changes in site-conditions on timing and/or success of migration? What are the consequences of human actions, e.g. hunting, on migration success? Download the model’s R-code from GitHub link - you may need to install additional R-packages like devtools, Rtools, zoo, maptools. Run the model using the standard parameter setting. Change one parameter at a time and observe which output measures change Develop an ecological question that you would like to tackle Come up with a plan of how to test your own question(s) which parameters would you need to change, change parameters by how much, which output measures would you look at, etc. Run the respective scenarios Analyse the results Evaluate the results 12.8 Student project 7: Estimating Migration volume Why would it be important to quantify the number of birds migrating? Look for possible reasons at Chapters 7 and 8. What is the total number and biomass of birds migrating? Are there changes in numbers and biomasses over the past decades? What might have caused these changes and which consequences could they have? Analyse overall ringing lists over the years 12.9 Student project 8: Why is timing in spring important? Finding the optimal time for reproduction is important for many species. In this project, you ask why is timing important based on literature and based on a small data set on nestling growth rate. The data contain nestling growth rates of Snowfinches Montifringilla nivalis and some predictors such as the age of the nestlings, the number of nestlings in the brood and how strongly snow was melting. The Snowfinch is a partial migrant. Use the data to answer how strongly nestling growth is related to snowmelt. Use the result as a motivation to discuss the importance of timing and possible consequences of climate change on breeding success. Naef-Daenzer and Keller (1999) Lerche-Jørgensen et al.

Among the various devices that exist to date, geolocators have been particularly useful for small (light-weight) birds. However, to get from the light patterns they record to positions requires advanced methods. A manual has been produced that details the necessary steps, the potential pitfalls and their solutions link. In this project, students apply existing analytical methods to individual geolocator data from selected species and: Analyse light patterns from geolocator recordings Translate a time series of light levels into geographical locations and present them on maps Derive the schedule of movements throughout the year 12.11 References References Briedis, Martins, and Silke Bauer. 2018. “Migratory Connectivity in the Context of Differential Migration.” Biology Letters 14 (12): 20180679. https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2018.0679.

Install the packages rmarkdown, bookdown, knitr, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2and arm by typing install.packages(\"rmarkdown\") etc. in the R-console. R-packages need to be installed only once, or after a major update of R. install.packages(c(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;, &quot;bookdown&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;tidyr&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;arm&quot;, &quot;bookdown&quot;)) 13.1.2 Working with R Writing and editing code is done in a text editor such as Wordpad or RStudio. RStudio is recommended because it is developed by the R development core team, it understands the R language and it communicates with R. We write the code in the text file (.r or .rmd) and send it to the R-console in RStudio using ctrl + enter. 13.1.3 Working with rmarkdown Rmarkdown allows knitting text with R code. The option to knit text with R code allows to write analyses reports without having to copy and paste results from the R console into a Word file. We can optionally show or hide R code and insert results directly in the text. Further, for sharing R code, it is extremely helpful to describe what the R code does in the text sections. Text is written in plain. Latex notation can be used. Helpful introductions exist online. R code is written within R chunks. In the header of the R chunks we can specify how the code, results and messages are shown in the output file. By pushing the “Knit” button all R-code is executed and displayed within a html, pdf or word document together with the text. The output format is specified in the header of the rmd-file. The R-console is the calculator. R can be used as a simple calculator or we can create objects, such as x and apply functions such as mean() to the objects. Functions are followed by round brackets () whithin which we can provide arguments. In the help file of the functions (open by ? followed by the name of the function), we can see what arguments a function needs and what default values the arguments have. # This is R-code, therefore text is outcommented by the hash-tag sign 36/5 # a mathematical expression ## [1] 7.2 x &lt;- c(4,7,3,6,2,7,4,3,4,6,2,8) # a vector, # x becomes an object in the R global environment mean(x) # apply a function to an object ## [1] 4.666667 # arguments of functions are defined with a specific order mean(4,7,3,6,2,7,4,3,4,6,2,8) # is not correct! ## [1] 4 # but mean(c(4,7,3,6,2,7,4,3,4,6,2,8)) # is correct ## [1] 4.666667 # check ?mean for arguments, order of arguments and default values 13.2 Linear regression 13.2.1 Theory You find the theory to this exercise in Chapter 11 in the online book Bayesian Data Analyses Using Linear Models in R and Stan. 13.2.2 Fitting a Linear Regression in R library(arm) ## Warning: Paket &#39;Matrix&#39; wurde unter R Version 4.2.3 erstellt library(dplyr) ## Warning: Paket &#39;dplyr&#39; wurde unter R Version 4.2.3 erstellt library(tidyr) library(ggplot2) ## Warning: Paket &#39;ggplot2&#39; wurde unter R Version 4.2.3 erstellt 13.2.3 Data We use weight data of snowfinches Montifringilla nivalis that have been captured and ringed during the winter months and we ask how the average weight changes with the time of the day. dat &lt;- read.table(&quot;data/SFringlistwinter.txt&quot;, header=TRUE, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;) # select winter month dat &lt;- dat[is.element(dat$month, c(0:3)),] dat$time.num &lt;- dat$time_hour + dat$time_min/60 plot(dat$time.num, dat$weight, xlab=&quot;Hour&quot;, ylab=&quot;Weight [g]&quot;, pch=16, col=rgb(0,0,0,0.5), cex=0.7) 13.2.4 Fit the regression using lm Theory mod &lt;- lm(weight~time.num, data=dat) mod ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = weight ~ time.num, data = dat) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) time.num ## 41.6403 0.1263 plot(dat$time.num, dat$weight, xlab=&quot;Hour&quot;, ylab=&quot;Weight [g]&quot;, pch=16, col=rgb(0,0,0,0.5), cex=0.7) abline(mod, col=&quot;brown&quot;) What does the function lm do?

See text for explanation. Would you trust this model? Do you think the model assumptions are met? Which structures of the data could violate the model assumptions? 13.2.6 Drawing Conclusions To answer the question about how strongly \\(y\\) is related to \\(x\\) taking into account statistical uncertainty we look at the estimated slope \\(\\beta_{1}\\) and its standard error (SE). The slope \\(\\beta_{1}\\) measures how much \\(y\\) increases in average when \\(x\\) is increased by 1 unit. The value of \\(\\beta_{1}\\) is calculated from the data at hand. It is therefore, a characteristics of the specific data. However, we would like to draw our conclusions more generally, i.e. also in future, for new data, we expect that \\(y\\) increases by \\(\\beta_{1}\\) if \\(x\\) increases by 1. However for these unmeasured, future data \\(\\beta_{1}\\) may look differently. No statistical method can exactly predict how \\(\\beta_{1}\\) will look for future data. However, if we assume that the model assumptions reflect the real world reasonable well, we can use the standard error (SE) as an estimate of how far away in average the estimated \\(\\beta_{1}\\) may be from the underlying true value, i.e. a \\(\\beta_{1}\\) that we would measure if we had sampled a very high number of (i.e., all) observations. summary(mod) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = weight ~ time.num, data = dat) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -10.0561 -3.3193 -0.0361 3.0881 14.8323 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

To draw a 95% compatibility interval around the regression line, we ﬁrst deﬁne new x-values for which we would like to have the ﬁtted values (about 100 points across the range of x will produce smooth-looking lines when connected by line segments).

If we want to describe where future observations will be, we have to report the prediction interval (see online book, posterior predictive distribution), or present the data within the plot of the regression line.

A possibility to quantify migratory connectivity is the estimation of the proportion of individuals that migrate from specific breeding areas to specific non-breeding areas, e.g. in Saunders et al. (2025), Rönn et al. (2020b). In order to estimate migratory connectivity it is required that we know of a large number of individuals from different breeding populations where they spend the non-breeding season. Often, it is not possible to track that many individuals from different populations. However, marking individuals such as ringing birds is done on a large scale by voluntary bird ringers and resightings or recoveries of such marked birds during the non-breeding season yields information on the connection of a breeding with a non-breeding areas by those birds that were resighted or recovered. The difficulty is that the probability of reencountering (resighting or recovering) a ringed bird very likely differs between different non-breeding area. Ring recovery probability depends primarily on human density and activity and also on the bird’s behaviour. As a consequence, the proportions of ring reecounters in the different non-breeding areas does not reflect the proportions of birds migrating to the different non-breeding areas in an unbiased way. However, when there are at least as many breeding areas as there are non-breeding areas considered in a study, the unbiased proportion of birds migrating to the different non-breeding areas becomes estimable. That is because, for example with two breeding areas (1 and 2) and two non-breeding areas (A and B), the following equations can be written: \\(N_1 = \\frac{R_{1A}}{r_A} + \\frac{R_{1B}}{r_B}\\) \\(N_2 = \\frac{R_{2A}}{r_A} + \\frac{R_{2B}}{r_B}\\) where \\(N_1\\) and \\(N_2\\) are the number of ringed birds in the breeding areas 1 and 2, \\(R_{1A}\\), \\(R_{2A}\\), \\(R_{1B}\\) and \\(R_{2B}\\) are the number of reencountered indidivuals from the two breeding areas in the two non-breeding areas, and \\(r_A\\) and \\(r_B\\) are the reencounter probabilities in the two non-breeding areas. Given the number of ringed individuals and the number of reencountered individuals are known, these equation system has two unknown parameters, \\(r_A\\) and \\(r_B\\) and can be solved. Knowing the reencounter probabilities, the proportions of birds that migrated from each breeding area to each non-breeding area can be calculated. Alternatively, we can model the number of reencounters from breeding area \\(i\\) using a multinomial model: \\((R_{iA}, R_{iB}, N_i -R_{iA} -R_{iB}) \\sim multinomial((m_{iA}r_A, m_{iB}r_B), 1-m_{iA}r_A-m_{iB}r_B)), N_i)\\), where \\(m_{iA}\\) and \\(m_{iB}\\) are the proportions of birds migrating from breeding area \\(i\\) to the non-breeding areas \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The model parameters are estimable when the number of breeding area is at least as high as the number of non-breeding areas. 15.2 Nightingale example The EURING data base contains 16 reencounters of Common Nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos in western Africa from birds ringed in W central Europe, 5 in western Africa from birds ringed in NE central Europe, 4 in central Africa from birds ringed in S central Europe and 1 each in western central and eastern Africa from birds ringed in E Europe (15.1). Figure 15.1: Ring recovery data of the Common nightingale. Lines connect the ringing location with the recovery location. Polygons indicate different breeding areas. Estimate the proportion of birds from each of the 4 breeding areas migrating to each of the 3 non-breeding areas within Africa.

"],["exSurvest.html", "Chapter 17 Exercise: Survival estimation 17.1 Introduction to mark-recapture modelling", " Chapter 17 Exercise: Survival estimation 17.1 Introduction to mark-recapture modelling Recapture or resightings (reencounters) of marked individuals inform about apparent survival, i.e. the probability that an individual survives and stays in the study area. Apparent survival differs from true survival because when the animals is seen last, it is still alive, i.e. the death is not observed. Thus, if an animal is no longer recaptured or resighted, we do not know whether it moved out of the study area or whether it died. Mark-recapture modelling techniques are designed to separately estimate recapture/resighting probability and apparent survival. To do so, they separate the observation process (recapturing or resighting an animal) from the biological process (staying in the study area and surviving). The basis for the development of an immense diversity of mark-recapture models has been set by the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model (Cormack 1964; Jolly 1965; Seber 1965). The CJS-model is introduced here using data on Snowfinches, a high alpine bird species that we study since 2015. load(&quot;data/annualCRdata.rda&quot;) # load datax object Since 2015, we individually marked 1310 Snowfinches. We systematically observed Snowfinches to read rings using scopes and cameras. We could resight 529 of the marked individuals in later years, many of them in more than one year. We collated the marking and resighting data in a capture history matrix \\(y\\). Each row of \\(y\\) contains the capture history of one individual and each column corresponds to a year from 2015 to 2023. A \\(1\\) indicates that the individual was resighted or recaptured during that year and a \\(0\\) indicates that the individual has not been seen. Thus, a \\(1\\) means the individual is alive in the study area and it has been detected by the researchers. A \\(0\\) could mean that the individual died, that it emigrated from the study area or that it is still alive in the study area but has not been detected by the researchers. index &lt;- order(datax$first) ch &lt;- datax$y[index,] plot(c(1,datax$nocc), c(1, datax$nind), type=&quot;n&quot;, axes=FALSE, xlab=&quot;Yeaer&quot;, ylab=&quot;Individual&quot;) axis(1, at=1:datax$nocc) axis(2, at=1:datax$nind, las=1, cex.lab=0.5) for(i in 1:datax$nind){ points(c(1:datax$nocc)[ch[i,]==1], rep(i,sum(ch[i,])), cex=.6) lines(c(1:datax$nocc)[ch[i,]==1], rep(i,sum(ch[i,]))) } Figure 17.1: Visualisation of the capture-recapture/resighting data. Each horizontal line connect capture or resightings of the same individual, a circle indicate that the individual is captured or resighted at least once during that year. Model description: The observations \\(y_{it}\\), an indicator of whether individual \\(i\\) was recaptured or resighted during year \\(t\\) is modeled conditional on the latent true state of the individual birds \\(z_{it}\\) (0 = dead or permanently emigrated, 1 = alive and at the study site) as a Bernoulli variable. The probability \\(P(y_{it} = 1)\\) is the product of the probability that an alive individual is recaptured or resighted, \\(p_{it}\\), and the state of the bird \\(z_{it}\\) (alive = 1, dead = 0). Thus, a dead bird cannot be recaptured or resighted, whereas for a bird alive during year \\(t\\), the recapture/resighting probability equals \\(p_{it}\\): \\[y_{it} \\sim Bernoulli(z_{it}p_{it})\\] The latent state variable \\(z_{it}\\) is a Markovian variable with the state at year \\(t\\) being dependent on the state at year \\(t-1\\) and the apparent survival probability \\(\\phi_{it}\\): \\[z_{it} \\sim Bernoulli(z_{it-1}\\phi_{it})\\] We use the notation \\(\\phi\\) to indicate that this parameter can be interpreted as apparent survival rather than true survival of which the standard notation would be \\(S\\) (D. L. Thomson et al. 2009). We model \\(\\phi\\) dependent on age (1=first year, 2=older) and year. \\[\\phi_{it} = \\alpha_{age-class[it], t} \\] Annual recapture/resighting probability is modeled for each year independently: \\[p_{it} = \\beta_{t}\\] We use uniform prior distributions for all parameters with a parameter space limited to values between 0 and 1 (probabilities), \\(\\alpha_{age-class,t} \\sim uniform(0,1)\\) and \\(\\beta_t \\sim uniform(0,1)\\). We use Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations as implemented in jags (Plummer 2003) to fit the model to the data. For doing so, we first need to specify the model using Jags language. We do that in a separate text-file (jags/cjs.txt). To fit the model, the Software jags need to be downloaded and installed. ## ## jags model code ## model{ ## ## likelihood ## for(i in 1:nind){ ## z[i,first[i]] &lt;- 1 ## for(t in (first[i]+1):nocc) { ## phiz[i, t-1] &lt;- z[i,t-1]*phi[i, t-1] ## z[i,t] ~ dbern(phiz[i, t-1]) ## zp[i,t] &lt;- z[i,t]*p[i,t-1] ## y[i,t] ~ dbern(zp[i,t]) ## } ## } ## ## ## linear predictors ## for(i in 1:nind){ ## for(t in first[i]:(nocc-1)){ ## phi[i,t] &lt;- a[age[i,t],t] ## p[i,t] &lt;- b[t] ## } ## } ## ## ## priors ## for(t in 1:(nocc-1)){ ## b[t] ~ dunif(0, 1) ## a[1,t] ~ dunif(0, 1) ## a[2,t] ~ dunif(0, 1) ## ## } ## } After having specified the model, we need to bundle the data into a list.

The chains look ok except for the parameters of the last year. For the last year, apparent survival cannot be separated from recapture/resighting probability. Thus, we must expect that these chains do not converge well. # check traceplot(mod) In the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model, for the last occasion, only the product of survival and recapture probability is estimable. Therefore, for these two parameters, it does not look like the Markov chains have converged.

You will know by now that the model is relatively complex and uses several parameters that might be tricky to derive. Therefore, we will use existing model code, go through the modelling steps together and look at several output possibilities. Due to some changes in dependent R-packages, and updates not being on Github yet, simply copy the code below and replace the code in “Workflow.R”. We will proceed as follows: * First, start R and install the required package “install_github(”slisovski/sdpMig”, force = TRUE)” * Find the directory, open project “sdpMig.Rproj” * Under files, open “Workflow.R” and overwrite it with R-code below * Try to run the code in “Workflow.R” line by line (we’ll do this together) 18.1 Exercises 18.1.1 Change Parameters Under files, find the folder “Parameters” and within it, find “WFGParameter_ex4_mod.csv”. Try changing some site-specific parameters, e.g. for * timing of food availability (see values for ) * amount of food available * predation risk parameters 18.1.2 Analyse resulting migration patterns Have a look at resulting migration patterns - mortality, places visited, staging times and body condition - and compare those to the outcomes of the original model. Try to find answers to questions such as * When do geese leave wintering grounds? * Which stop-over sites do they use for how long? Start changing some parameters, e.g. food availability: * Which parameters primarily change staging times? * What happens if specific sites are not available anymore? * How does body condition change over time and why? 18.2 Code to replace existing code in “Workflow.R” The following code replaces existing code in file “Workflow.R”. install_github(&quot;slisovski/sdpMig&quot;, force = TRUE) library(sdpMig) library(zoo) library(ggplot2) library(sf) library(rnaturalearth) ############################################### ### Parameters ################################ ############################################### parms &lt;- list( MaxT = 100, ## Maximum time MaxX = 100, ## Maximum body condition NSites = 8, ## Excl.

To this end, we’ll look at some recent works and discuss what their findings mean. Let’s first discuss in class and compile which processes would be important to consider. Work in groups on compiling evidence (or not) of migrants influencing ecosystem processes and community dynamics. Have a read of the starting point and major results of the following papers (not details). * Wildebeest in Serengeti link * Insects in UK/Europe link * Migrants in Arctic food web link * Pacific salmon link * Think about the following questions: * What (which factors &amp; processes) do migratory animals change in resident communities? * How does the food web/ community/ ecosystem look like without migratory animals? * Which effect do you think do these changes have? * Is it a relevant process/factor, e.g. compared to similar processes? * Abrahms, Briana, Elliott L Hazen, Ellen O Aikens, Matthew S Savoca, Jeremy A Goldbogen, Steven J Bograd, Michael G Jacox, Ladd M Irvine, Daniel M Palacios, and Bruce R Mate. 2019. “Memory and resource tracking drive blue whale migrations.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 116 (12): 5582–87. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1819031116.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> What is migration?</h2>
<p>Not all birds migrate and not all movements are migratory movements. The types of movements that exist range from:
1. local movements between roosting and feeding sites, movements within the home range
2. foraging journeys (e.g. sea birds, swifts),<br />
3. dispersal: juvenile (natal) dispersal, breeding dispersal,<br />
4. migration, including its most common form of seasonal migration but also nomadism and irrup-tive migrations.</p>
<p>Migrations are persistent, directional movements from one destination to another, uninterrupted by intervening resources (Dingle 2014). The distances covered are often astounding, yet, the most ex-traordinary aspects of migration are perhaps the ubiquity of the phenomenon and the abundance of individuals involved. For instance, an estimated 1855 bird species (19% of extant species) are migrato-ry. Of the avian species that use terrestrial and freshwater habitats, roughly 45% of those breeding in North America undergo seasonal migration, and over 30% breeding in the Palearctic migrate to sub-Saharan Africa, with many more migrating within Europe. Although accurate estimates of the number of individuals involved are scant, more than 2 billion passerine birds are found to migrate to sub-Saharan Africa, whereas upwards of 3 billion insects migrate over any 1-km stretch of countryside in southern England. Thus, Migration is set apart from the other movement types by i) its timing, frequency and predictability, ii) the intensity of interactions with resident species, and iii) the spatial scales over which they connect communities and ecosystems.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-do-birds-migrate" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Why do birds migrate?</h2>
<p>The classic bird migration is the biannual migration between breeding and non-breeding (‘wintering’) grounds. The breeding grounds are suitable for nesting and hatchling/fledgling survival, whereas the wintering grounds are more suitable for post-fledgling and adult survival. Migration is thought to be primarily an adaptation to the seasonality of resources - to use (a surplus of) resources that are only seasonally available and to avoid shortage of resources at specific times of the year.
Indeed, almost all places on Earth are seasonal to some degree and therefore, many migrants move between these seasonally available resources. For instance, many birds breeding in Europe migrate to the Sahel-zone in Africa in the Northern winter. The advantage of being in an area that provides better condition outweighs the cost of migration. In the temperate zones, it are usually those species that leave the breeding area during winter that have specific food requirements, which is not available dur-ing winter, e.g. insects, but abundant in the Sahel after rainfall. Many species, e.g. the Red-backed shrike Lanius collurio (Tøttrup et al. 2012), migrate within the non-breeding season between distinct non-breeding areas in order to make use of seasonally changing food availability.<br />
There may be also other forms of migration or migrations as a strategy to avoid predator sor patho-gens.
Other migration than seasonal migration are moult and facultative migrations. In moult migrations, birds appear to migrate to predator-free areas where they can safely shed their flight feathers. In facultative migrations, birds only migrate long-distances when food is sparse, e.g. many finches (Newton 2006). At an extreme end of the spectrum are birds that are nomadic, like grey teal (Anas gracilis) looking for ephemeral water and food sources in a desert landscape in Australia.
Two main flight modes exist – flapping and soaring, which has consequences on when and where birds migrate: Flapping flight is energetically costly but can be used under a wide range of weather and topographic conditions, whereas for soaring thermals or wind are needed.
The majority of birds cannot feed while flying, and in many cases the total travel distance exceeds the maximum flight distance. Thus, the birds need stop-over sites in between, where they can replenish their reserves. A good example are tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) that migrate between 4000-5500 km, whereas the maximally recorded non-stop flight is 2850 km. These swans mainly refuel on energy-rich, belowground parts of macrophytes in shallow lakes and wetlands along the route.</p>

<div id="terminology-of-specific-migration-patterns" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Terminology of specific migration patterns</h2>
<p>There is a variety of migration patterns of which some are also tagged with specific terms. Often it is a specific characteristic or pattern that is emphasized, e.g. the difference in distances covered led to the distinction of short- and long-distance migrants. However, the terminology is not very consistent and may be confusing at the beginning; we explain the most-often used terms below.</p>
<p>Box 1. Terminology for specific migration characteristics and patterns and a few examples.</p>
<p><strong>Short-distance migration</strong> Migration over ‘shorter’ distances, typically &lt;5000kms, e.g. from Central Europe to the Mediterranean. Sometimes, short-distance migrants are also partial migrants. Starling Sturnus vulgaris</p>
<p><strong>Long-distance migration</strong> Migration over longer distances, usually &gt;5000kms and often including the crossing of ecological barriers such as moun-tains, seas or deserts. Arctic tern Sterna para-disaea, Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica</p>
<p><strong>Nomadism</strong> Irregular (not every year) movements to new breeding or non-breeding areas depending on food availability or other environmental conditions. Crossbill Loxia curviros-tra</p>
<p><strong>Irruptive migration</strong> Migration of unusually many individuals of one species. Of-ten from north to south in autumn after a good breeding sea-son and a cold spell; usually do not occur every year, but can be relatively regular and synchronized between species (Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2008). Great tit Parus major, Coal tit Parus ater</p>
<p><strong>Moult migration</strong> Migration after the breeding season to distinct places where the birds moult before autumn migration. Goosanders Mergus merganser (European populations moult in northern Norway)</p>
<p><strong>Leap-frog migrations</strong> Populations breeding further north spend the non-breeding season further south than breeding populations from further south. Thus, some populations “overtake” others on migra-tion. European robin Eritha-cus rubecula (Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2014)</p>
<p><strong>Chain migration</strong> Northern breeding populations spend the non-breeding peri-od in breeding areas of southern populations. Thus, a spe-cies can be observed year-round but it are different individu-als in winter/ summer. Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo (Fred-eriksen et al. 2018)</p>
<p><strong>Broad front migration</strong> Individuals disperse over the whole distributional range while migrating (theoretically a lot of parallel flight tracks dispersed over a large area). Yet, migrants can still accumulate de-pending on topography and funnel through narrow areas. Chaffinch Fringilla coe-lebs, many passerines: (Liechti et al. 1996)</p>
<p><strong>Funnel migration</strong> All individuals of a species (or population) concentrate on migration in one stop over area or a topographically im-portant place such as Gibraltar. Crane Grus grus, many waders (Yellow sea!)</p>
<p><strong>Nocturnal migration</strong> Most songbirds migrate at night, i.e. they are nocturnal mi-grants. This behavior has been attributed to reduced preda-tion risk, good flight conditions, or for saving the daylight for feeding. Nocturnal migrants mostly fly alone or in loose flocks. Most migratory song-birds, e.g. Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe</p>
<p><strong>Diurnal migration</strong> Migratory flights take place during the day. Many larger birds are diurnal migrants, e.g. birds of prey that use thermals or swans and geese that often fly in flocks. Red kites, bee-eaters, many geese species</p>
<p><strong>Partial migration</strong> Only a part of a population migrates while the remaining part stays resident. Which individuals stay and which migrate has often a genetic background, and in some years, the migrato-ry part enjoys a fitness benefit while in other years the resi-dents are better off.</p>

<div id="importance-of-migration-for-the-structure-and-dynamics-of-resident-communities" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Importance of migration for the structure and dynamics of resident communities</h2>
<p>The number of migrant populations often exceeds those of resident species. For instance, we estimat-ed the number of (passerine) birds migrating between Europe and Africa to be impressive 2.1. billion individuals (Hahn et al. 2009)! To cross the Sahara on their way to Africa, they need the energy of 34’000 tons of insects, 36’000 tons of fruit and 2’000 tons of seeds.
If we consider migrants more generally, i.e. beyond birds, we find that migrants transport nutrients, energy, and other organisms (including seeds, mollusks, parasites, and pathogens) between disparate locations. Migrants also forage and are preyed upon throughout their journeys, thereby establishing transport and trophic interactions with resident communities. Migratory animals thus couple ecological communities across the globe and may mediate their diversity and stability. However, as yet, the influ-ence of migrants and their services on these communities is often overlooked, and as a consequence of global changes, migrations are threatened worldwide.</p>
<p>Through these transport and trophic effects, migrants interact with resident communities. For instance, they may uniquely alter energy flow, food-web topology and stability, trophic cascades, and the struc-ture and dynamics of (meta-)communities. For example, the inputs of nutrients and energy originating from distant localities by migrants can dramatically increase resource availability, with rippling conse-quences for productivity at various trophic levels and the potential to drive the transition between alter-native stable states. Migrant-mediated transport of propagules of other organisms can lead to the es-tablishment of new or lost species, as well as influencing gene fl ow and genetic mixing among resident populations. Similarly, migrants can alter parasite transmission, diversity, and evolution by harboring a broader range of parasites than residents and by either facilitating or hindering the longdistance dis-persal of parasites. Foraging by migrants can also have profound effects on community processes and ecosystem functions. For instance, grazing by migratory animals can alter nutrient cycling, primary productivity, biomass of edible plants, competitive interactions between plant species, and ultimately, the composition and long-term persistence of the entire plant community. The most striking difference between migrant and resident consumers is, however, the pulsed nature of migrant utilization and the timing of their interactions. Together, these fundamentally defi ne the relationship between migrant abundance and primary production (in the case of migrant herbivores) or the stability of food webs (in the case of migratory predators).</p>
<p>The highly predictable, seasonally pulsed nature of animal migration, together with the spatial scales at which it operates and the immense number of individuals involved, not only set migration apart from other types of movement, but render it a uniquely potent, yet underappreciated, dimension of biodiver-sity that is intimately embedded within resident communities. Given the potential for migration to influ-ence ecological networks worldwide, we suggest integrative network approaches, through which stud-ies of community dynamics and ecosystem functioning may explicitly consider animal migrations, un-derstand the ramifications of their declines, and assist in developing effective conservation measures.</p>

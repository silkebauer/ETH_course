# Introduction

## Course aims

Students will

* gain a general understanding of migration, its causes and consequences
* understand the functions of bird migration and its implications for population dynamics and ecological communities
* apply or get introduced to some frequently used ornithological field methods 
* interpret information from various data sources (e.g. observations, mark-recapture, data loggers, tracking methods, blood samples, genetics) and evaluate their representativeness and accuracy
* identify the more common European migrating bird species


For the **conceptual background**, we will cover the following aspects:

* Morphological and physiological adaptation to flight 
* Life cycle of birds (breeding, post-fledging, molting, migration, staging)
* Ecology and evolution of bird migration
* Timing of migration
* Migration strategies and orientation
* Global change and migration


For **practical and field methods**, we will introduce some of the most important field methods: 

* counting and identifying migrating birds, 
* bird catching and marking, 
* morphological and physiological measurements,
* tracking birds


**Student projects** are ideally conducted in groups of 2-4 persons. We expect students to choose a project during the first two days of the course (see list of potential projects \@ref(Sec:StudentProjects)). There are several slots for work on these projects over the course week and we expect students to give a brief (approx. 20 min) presentation on Friday, detailing the ecological question behind the project, the analytical approach chosen, the results obtained and a discussion. 
Within the student projects, we will introduce and apply important **theoretical approaches and analytical methods**


## Course schedule

The course consists of lectures, project work and excursions.

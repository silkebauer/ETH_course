# Introduction

## Course aims

Students will

* gain a general understanding of migration, its causes and consequences
* understand the functions of bird migration and its implications for population dynamics and ecological communities
* apply some frequently used ornithological field methods 
* interpret information from various data sources (e.g. observations, mark-recapture, data loggers, tracking methods, blood samples, genetics) and evaluate their representativeness and accuracy
* identify the more common European migrating bird species


For the **conceptual background**, we will cover the following aspects:

* Morphological and physiological adaptation to flight 
* Life cycle of birds (breeding, post-fledging, molting, migration, staging)
* Ecology and evolution of bird migration
* Physiology and energetics of flight
* Migration strategies and orientation


For **practical and field methods**, we will introduce some of the most important field methods: 

* counting and identifying migrating birds, 
* bird catching and marking, 
* morphological and physiological measurements in live birds,
* tracking birds

  
Within the student projects, we will introduce and apply important **theoretical approaches and analytical methods**

* dynamic models of bird migration
* distribution methods
* analyses of tracking data
*

## Preparations

We ask students to prepare for the course by reading and summarizing at least two papers - one general paper and one specific research paper and to introduce them to your fellow students during the course. 
In your summary, please address the following points

1. Summarize the article 
  - what was the main question?
  - what were the main results?
  
2. Summarize the approach used
  - What is the general approach?
  - How could you characterize the model?
  - Which are the important variables and why?
  - Which scenarios were run?

3. Make your own assessment of the articles
  - Was it a convincing article?

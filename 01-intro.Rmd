# Introduction

## Course schedule
Covid-19 information: The form of the planned course does not fulfil the requirements officially reliesed by the ETH until 31. 8. 2020. Therefore, the course only can take place in the planned format if the regulations will be eased after 1. 9. 2020. If not, the course will take place in an alternative format including home teaching and day trips. 

We will decide on the format of the course by 15th July. By then, you will find the schedule of the course here.

The course consists of lectures, student work on projects and visits to the ringing station (or daily excursions). As the latter is dependent on weather, the schedule is not entirely fixed but somewhat flexible.

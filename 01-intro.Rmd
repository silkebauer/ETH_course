# Introduction

## Course schedule

The course consists of lectures, student work on projects and visits to the ringing station. As the latter is dependent on weather, the following schedule is not entirely fixed but somewhat flexible. 

Covid-19 regulations: The form of the planned course does not fulfil the hygienic requirements officially reliesed by the ETH until 31. 8. 2020. Therefore, the course only can take place in this format if the regulations will be eased after 1. 9. 2020. If not, the course will take place in an alternative format including home teaching and day trips.

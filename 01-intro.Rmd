# Introduction

## Course aims

Students will

* gain a general understanding of migration, its causes and consequences
* understand the functions of bird migration and its implications for population dynamics and ecological communities
* apply some frequently used ornithological field methods 
* interpret information from various data sources (e.g. observations, mark-recapture, data loggers, tracking methods, blood samples, genetics) and evaluate their representativeness and accuracy
* identify the more common European migrating bird species


For the **conceptual background**, we will cover the following aspects:

* Morphological and physiological adaptation to flight 
* Life cycle of birds (breeding, post-fledging, molting, migration, staging)
* Ecology and evolution of bird migration
* Physiology and energetics of flight
* Migration strategies and orientation


For **practical and field methods**, we will introduce some of the most important field methods: 

* counting and identifying migrating birds, 
* bird catching and marking, 
* morphological and physiological measurements in live birds,
* tracking birds

  
Within the student projects, we will introduce and apply important **theoretical approaches and analytical methods**

* dynamic models of bird migration
* distribution methods
* analyses of tracking data
*

## Preparations

We ask students to prepare for the course by reading at least two papers - one general paper and one specific research paper (see below) - and to introduce the key messages of these papers to your fellow students during the course (for guidelines to reading and summarizing papers, see \@ref(Sec:StudentProjects). 
Please let us know (via email) until **3 September 2020** which papers you choose and also send us up to three questions that you would like to have answered during the course.


**General papers, reviews, synthesis**
- [@Bauer.2014], [@Bauer2017],  
- [@Muheim.2014] - sensory orientation & navigation
- [@Webster.2002] - migratory connectivity
- Migration strategies
- Timing
- Global change: Runge et al. 
- [@Chapman2015a] - insetc migration review
- [@Runge2015] - global conervation of migratory birds

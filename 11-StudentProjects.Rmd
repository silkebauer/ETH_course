# Student projects

We encourage students to work on a research project during the course. We have compiled a list of suggested projects (see below) but students may come up with their own suggested project within the realm of bird and migration ecology. 


## Phenology: Migration patterns within the season and their changes over the years

Phenology characterises the temporal course of migration. Naturally, phenology has different aspects, e.g. how individuals of a species migrate in a particular season (spread-out over season or almost synchronized), how different is the migration pattern between seasons (e.g. spring and autumn migration), how different is the timing of migration between species (which species migrate late, which early), how has the timing of migration changed over the years, etc.

Potential research questions that you may select, include:
- Within a species: characterise phenology of migration for different sexes or age classes in a single season. Who is early, who late?

- Between species comparison: Characterise a selection of species in their migration phenology. Which species migrate early, which late? How different is the among-year variance in the timing of migration?


Start with a description of the migration pattern for the selected species and groups of individuals within the species. Then, try to link the timing of migration to ecological variables.  

Which species/groups of individuals migrate early or late and why?
Link migration patterns (median of migration) to ecological variables such as migration route, food and other species-traits
Has the timing of peak migration changed over the years? If so, in which species? What could be potential reasons?



Data required:

Migration data "zugzeiten.txt"
- Variable baird.mean is an estimate for the average passage day corrected for truncation (migration is still ongoing at the end of the field season) 
- passage_by_spec_year.txt: Median passage day per year and species
- species_data.txt: ecological characteristica of species

Environmental data
Some NDVI data over the years?

R-code for analyses



## Long-term changes in morphology

Has wing length changed over the years in specific species? Are there patterns, e.g. in short- and long-distance migrants? How could this pattern be explained, i.e. which processes or constraints may play a role?

## Differential Migration

Do young and old birds or males and females migrate at different times? If such sub-groups migrate at different times in specific species, what could explain these patterns? Potential test species: age-differences in reed warblers, age- and sex-differences in chaffinches. 

	Analyse species-specific ringing lists



## Flight energetics in the course of a night and over the season
Dynamics of fat reserves: how do the fat reserves change over the night and over the season

comparison with expectations based on energetics and aero-physics  

	Analyse species-specific ringing lists

## Estimate survival from capture-recapture data 
Marking and recapturing individual birds allows for estimating apparent survival probability (= the probability that a bird survives and returns to the breeding site). Do survival probabilities correlate with conditions in the wintering area?

	Analyse a mark-recapture data set of reed warblers from a constant ringing effort site 
using MCMC (software: Jags)


## Modelling (spring) migration: several questions

Look at Chapter \@ref(Sec:MigModels) again for background on state-dependent migration models. 

You could use an existing model and tackle one or more of the following questions:
-	Long-term changes in migration phenology - which site conditions make animals change their timing? 
-	Consequences of climate-driven changes in site-conditions
-	Consequences of human actions, e.g. hunting, on migration success

Download model from GitHub [link](https://github.com/slisovski/sdpMig) - you may need to install the R-packages devtools, Rtools, zoo, maptools. 


 dynamic migration model and analyse your own scenarios 

Studies using such migration model:
[@Bauer2018]


**What should you do before the course?**
1. Read the articles
2. Summarize the model: 
  - what are the state-variables?
  - which are the important variables and why?
  - what was the main question?
  - what were the main results?
3. Make your own assessment of the articles

4. 

**During the course**
1. Try to get the model running with the standard parameter setting.
2. Change one parameter at a time and observe which output measures change
3. Come up with a plan of how to test your own question(s), i.e. which parameters would you need to change, by how much, which output measures would you loo at, etc.
4. Run the respective scenarios
5. Analyse the results
6. Interpretation of results





## Estimating Migration volume
-	What is the total number and biomass of birds migrating?
-	Are there changes in numbers and biomasses over the past decades?
-	What might have caused these changes and which consequences could they have?

## Partial migration: Who stays in winter?

In partially migratory species, some individuals migrate while others remain as year-round residents. Partial migration is widespread among birds. Who migrates can be determined genetically, by individual charachters (sex, age, body condition), or by environmental conditions. We expect that individuals migrating benefit from a higher survival because they escape unfriendly winter conditions. On the other hand, those individuals enduring winter at the breeding site may benefit from an increased reproductive success, e.g., because they can start earlier, know the breeding sites and may occupy better breeding territories, or because they have more chances for mating.

The White-winged Snowfinch *Montifringilla nivalis nivalis* is a partial migrant living at high elevations (above the tree line) in southern European mountain areas. In other subspecies, the species occurs in mountain areas from Turkey eastward until the Himalaya. The Snowfinch is highly adapted to living at high-elevation harsh climate. In Switzerland, it can be observed during winter at feeders in ski areas or mountain huts. Its migration behaviour is still largely unknown. In the Pyrenees and in southern France, wintering indivividuals can be regularly observed, ocassionally in large numbers. Ring recoveries also indicate seasonal migration (Fig. \@ref(fig:migsnowfinch)). 

```{r migsnowfinch, fig.cap="Seasonal migration of Snowfinches as observed by ring recoveries. Arrows connect the ringing location with the recovery location.
